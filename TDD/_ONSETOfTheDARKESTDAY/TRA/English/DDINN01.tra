@0    = ~Aye there... I've not been feelin' so good, but that won't stop me from givin' up some beds, eh? If you need a place to sleep, just give me a holler.~
@1    = ~Let me see your selection of rooms.~
@2    = ~I don't need anything at the moment.~
@3    = ~Can you tell me anything about the recent storm and plague?~
@4    = ~Well it seems like they both came about at near the same time. People've been goin' missing or gettin' real sick on us... even I'm feelin' the effects right now, and I wouldn't be surprised if you do, too. Doesn't seem like it takes long for the sickness to take over.~
@5    = ~All the while there's been talk of some mountain in the sky... You can even see it out the window if you look real hard. It doesn't look exactly like a mountain to me, though... more like a castle of a sort. I guess it doesn't matter. Strange is strange.~
@6    = ~Thanks for your time.~
