@2    = ~What the hell is that supposed to mean?~
@3    = ~I understand. I will do as you say.~
@4    = ~I cannot say more.~
@5    = ~I thank you, visitor... Perhaps now you understand that I needed the four elements of Faerun: fire, water, earth, and magic.~
@6    = ~It is a shame that I must do this now, but I have been informed it is the only resolution to this mess... Fight me. You cannot help yourself. Fight me. Now!~
