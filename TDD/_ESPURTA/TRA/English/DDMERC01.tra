@0    = ~Ah, good day to you, fair <LADYLORD>.~
@1    = ~Aye, to you too. Where do you hail from?~
@2    = ~What's so good about it?~
@3    = ~Well, I don't really come from anywhere. However, I've just recently visited the Barbarian village to the north and east. A tall lot, those barbarians. And they like fighting... lots of fighting. Of course, you can tell that I am not suited very well to such a place.~
@4    = ~You, however, seem rather dirty and ready for a fight.. Here, I'll mark the route on your map for you. Oh, my time's running out. I must be in Calimshan in a month's time. Fare thee well!~
@5    = ~Oh nothing really... I just came from a Barbarian village north of here. Very angry and dirty those barbarians. They just weren't my type of people...~
