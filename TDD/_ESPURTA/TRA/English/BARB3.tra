@0    = ~Well met, and my thanks go out to you! I am Ornamus, current leader of our clan. I say current because our leader King Heafnall has not yet to returned from his trek north to the Troll Mountains. I can only fear for the worst. These damn Yuan-ti have been coming from everywhere of late, and seem to be intent on attacking all the small dwellings in the area.~
@1    = ~I suppose our little camp fills that description. Several of our huts have been routed recently. Anyway, we have fended the beasts off well enough. We shall celebrate the victory with fine ale and praise to Tempus.~
@2    = ~You must have travelled far to get here. Come friend...you and your party can join the feast and rest. Later we will discuss things in detail, but now is time for celebration!~
@3    = ~Thank you, friend. We shall look into your predicament when we are able. In the meantime, your hospitality is greatly welcome.~
@4    = ~I don't really feel like helping you, but I guess I don't have much of a choice. Very well, then. Let us rest.~
