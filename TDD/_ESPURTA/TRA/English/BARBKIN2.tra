@0    = ~Greetings, Ornamus. I see you have managed to fend off the yuan-ti, but I was not able to find the source. And with my wounds, I doubt I will be able to continue the search for some time.~
@1    = ~Yes, I found king Heafnall being held captive by the Duergar. He was only a matter of moments away from meeting the same painful death that your unfortunate kin had received.~
@2    = ~Yes, I owe you my life, and I really don't know how I can repay you. Wait... I have something here... it is of great value, and something I think you will cherish.~
@3    = ~Before we trekked south, we lived far north in conditions so extreme that people of Amn would last only a few days in the wild. Here we found a strange armor.~
@4    = ~It's creation completely baffles us. We suspect that it has magical properties, and with you making the trip to the Troll Mountains, this may help protect you.~
@5    = ~Take this armour as a token of our tribes gratitude to you, and know that you are welcome here whenever you are near. My tribe and I wish you gain the favor of Tempos during your trek in the mountains. I suggest you make your way through the caves.~
@6    = ~The Duergar should be few by now so you can resume your route. The passage to the southeast should take you on your way. Farewell friend, and make sure you return in one piece.~
