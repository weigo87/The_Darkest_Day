@0    = ~'Ey there, friend. Good to see someone around here willing to protect us. Anyway, I'm just gonna start babbling again, so I might as well get at it. I've got some potions in stock here and I can cast a good number of healing spells if you're hurt. So, what d'ya need?~
@1    = ~Nothing now. I'll be back later.~
@2    = ~Let me see what you've got there.~
