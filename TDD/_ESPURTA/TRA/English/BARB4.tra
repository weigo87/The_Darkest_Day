@0    = ~Ah, you have recovered well, my friend. I must thank you for your aid. However, I must ask a favor of you.~
@1    = ~Our King went in search of the source of these raids a few days ago. However, he has yet to return, and I fear for the worst. We are all to wounded and malnourished to search for him ourselves... I beg of you to search for him and return him if you are able.~
@2    = ~I am sorry Ornamus but my time here is over, I need to continue north without distractions and your king is just that.~
@3    = ~I will aid you. We, too, were looking for the source of the raids. If we find the king, we will return him safely.~
@4    = ~A shame... We thank you for the help with the Yuan-ti, but you are no longer welcome here. I suggest you leave soon; a dagger is sure to find your back if you stay too long. It might even be mine.~
@5    = ~My greatest thanks. I just pray that you do not befall the same fate as him. You may make use of some of our healing and resupply before you leave. Tempos be with you!~
