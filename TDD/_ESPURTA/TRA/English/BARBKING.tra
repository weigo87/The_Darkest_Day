@0    = ~Stay back! Stay back or--Whe...Where are those gray bastards?~
@1    = ~Calm down, sir. We are searching for a King Heafnall. Have you seen him down here?~
@2    = ~You dare to threaten me, fool? I have just slain a whole dwarven pack. Now I am looking for King Heafnall and his barbarian travellers. Can you help me?~
@3    = ~I am King Heafnall, but my men's blood is what colors this floor crimson red. These duergar will pay a high price for this heartless slaughter.~
@4    = ~They deserve all you and your tribe give them. It seems they have lost all sense of morality over the centuries.~
@5    = ~My tribe...so you have met them? And Ornamus is leading them well, I hope. (sigh) The wretched yuanti were seriously reducing our numbers, My attempt to find the source was stopped before we even reached the mountain's foot thanks to the scum in these tunnels.~
@6    = ~I need to return to my camp, but I am far too weak to make the trek myself. Would you do my tribe one more favor, and return me? You shall be repaid and compensated for fully.~
@7    = ~That I will do. I have promised Ornamus, and I shall see it through. We should leave with haste to avoid ambush.~
@8    = ~I think not. I have a greater goal, and carrying your nearly gangrenous body will only slow me down. I suggest you leave, but staying will suffice just as well. Either way you are not likely to last to long. Farewell, Heafnall.~
