@0    = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. I bet you thought that you'd seen the last of us.~
@1    = ~Now we are stronger... better. We belong to the master. Our orders are for your death. The master wishes it so, so it will be done.~
@2    = ~Before you resort to killing me, tell me who this master is!~
@3    = ~Let's see if I can kill you for good this time.~
@4    = ~You do not even know! Cyric is returning, and he will not be stopped by anything! With the relic powering him, and with you out of the way, he will be unstoppable! You stand no chance, <CHARNAME>! Draw arms for this battle... this is sure to be the last encounter between the two of us.~
