@0    = ~10,000 gold... He must be really be something. The mages usually go after their enemies themselves. I've got a feeling were expendable for this task.~
@1    = ~Yeah, but they said he's been working from behind the scenes; hiring underlings and building a stronghold. I don't know why we accepted this. I don't want to fight a guy with his own stronghold!~
@2    = ~I don't know... he didn't seem right in the head. I don't know if I like killing for the Temple of Lathander either... it makes me kind of apprehensive.~
@3    = ~Hmm... robes, male, looks elven... and who else hangs around this area? It must be him!~
@4    = ~No... no, this is completely wrong. It's someone else... he doesn't look so dangerous.~
