Kagain discovered that many merchants have found ways to avoid the sanctions against magic and so, don't need to hire mercenaries.

Kagain was thinking of closing this business and heading out to Saradush or Riatavin, both said to be having serious problems recently. Meeting up with <CHARNAME> has given him a chance to try something else for awhile. Hopefully for him, this will be much more profitable.~

@20097 = ~Yeslick~

For generations they used the iron mine in the center of Cloakwood as their home, but almost a century ago catastrophe struck. As skilled as they are underground, dwarves occasionally make mistakes.  One such incident cost them dearly. They apparently breached an underground river and the resulting flood claimed nearly all of the clan. Yeslick was one of the few survivors, and made his way to Sembia to start a new life. There he made the acquaintance of Rieltar, a member of the Iron Throne, and was hired as a personal smith. They became friends, and eventually Yeslick told of his past. This proved to be his undoing, as Rieltar used this information to formulate a plan to expand the Iron Throne power base in the Sword Coast.  Rieltar betrayed his supposed friend and forced him to reveal the location of the mines. Yeslick has been imprisoned ever since so as not to reveal the site to others. Now he wishes for nothing but the chance to right the wrongs that have been committed using his ancestral home.~

He mutters something about how he and his associate Montaron are in the employ of a powerful group, but when pressed for details he gets extremely agitated and does not speak for some time. He is obviously at least partially insane, and the network that would hire him must be dark indeed.~

@20126 = ~Adario is and always has been a one man army in his treks across the realms surface. Very little is known of his birthplace but he was raised at a young age in the bustling city of Calimport. Still being so young, he lost his parents to the thugs and was taken by the guild to be raised as the next generation of thieves. With those memories too early in his life to remember, Adario was the perfect tool to train and obey every desire of his guild master.
    A decade or two later he had performed petty theft to many times to feel satisfied and was far more effective in combat to waste his time stealing for small profits. With his superior skills to others in the guild, he was not wasted and was honed into being a deadly assassin with the melee skill to deal with the deadliest of foe. Only a few years later he had taken the scalps of great mages and kings for huge bounties and was a most feared body on Faerun.
    With his surprisingly good looks and black greasy hair, he remained in Calimport no more and ventured north to other places of great wealth such as Waterdeep and Baldur's gate. His guild master wasn?t too pleased to lose his great assassin but he wouldn't dare argue with the now deadly arms master. Walking the streets of new towns, he was a perfect target for thugs, being slim and looking anything but deadly. They came in with confidence only to drop to their knees clenching the new smile on their throat. With a reputation all along the Sword Coast he is a headhunter with a perfect success rate. Assassination is not all that he requires though. He has personal goals and will trust, to a certain extent, others to achieve those goals. But the risk of accepting one of Adario?s kind into an adventuring group is a two-sided coin. It can turn good and just as easily turn bad~

However, for Avaunis, earning his knighthood has been a long trial for himself and his family.  His father past away many years ago and though the Radiant Heart has always assisted them, Avaunis was never sure if he would be accepted into the order without a sponsor.  So for many years he worked as a squire to the other knights.  His hard work and dedication to the order didn't go unnoticed.  When he was ready, the Prelate himself sponsored Avaunis.

Avaunis has just earned his knighthood and is hoping to find challenges that will bring honor to the order.  He believes that setting the right example for others will help change these troubled times, even if only in a small way.  The years of shining armor, polishing boots, and preparing the hall for ceremonies has taught him that no task is too small or humble to accept and accomplish with pride.~

Very much in it for the money, Robillard was open to most tasks, but was certainly no assassin and would draw the line at tasks that his magic could perform. Eventually he was hired on a long term contract to be the Evoker aboard the lord-funded Sea Sprite, a rapid sailing schooner made for sinking pirate ships in the area, captained by Duerdemont. Over the years his immense fireballs burned the ships to ash before the rogues could even come close. The schooner could catch large ships in minutes with the magical winds he conjured into their sails. Years passed, life was easy and simple, but even a mage can't always get it right. Of late, the Sea Aprite was badly damaged by a misdirected lightning bolt and would require a few hard months to fix. In the meantime, as a very much marked man by the pirates of Waterdeep's filthy streets, Robillard went south to the Amn region to pass time and to avoid trouble from those who might seek to harm him. With little doubt, pirates would gather huge bounties to see his head on a stake, a fact that Robillard knows all too well.~

Vesine escaped successfully, and was resting in a clearning when she was knocked unconcscious. When she awakened, most of her possessions were gone, and she was injured very badly.
Vesine says that she recovered by crawling into a nearby pond where her injuries would heal faster. Ever since then, she has been wandering the forests, too weak to go back to the her sea.

This spell causes the mage to rot the actual mind of a pre-targeted creature. Upon uttering the necromantic words, the targeted creature must save vs. spells or the spell will take effect. Mind Rot will sap 1 point of intelligence every round as well as preventing spell casting. Eventually the target's mind is reduced to nothing but a pulp and he will drop dead as a brain-dead corpse.

This spell is an extremely dangerous spell that can however grant immense benefits to the caster. Upon uttering the phrases the mage sustains 1D10 hit points of damage but this is due to the fact that he has split the very molecules that form his present, upon them splitting he will appear little more than a blur and thoughtless attacks will pass straight through his blurry presence. However the spell is very dangerous, after the duration of 6 rounds the molecular structure of the mage will attempt to reform, this 75% of the time is successful but it can fail and if this happens the mage will simply drop dead in the form of what is left of his body. Also though, the spell will make make the recipient of the spell very open to magical attacks and will have a -40% magic resistance and receives more damage from magic despite his immunity to almost any physical attack.~

It is said that the soul is the very centre of every living thing, without it the body will cease to exist and this spell is the mage's attempt to rid a creature of its soul. He will utter a passage that will effect the targets soul if they fail to make a save. The following chart displays the Saving Throws required and the consequences of a failed Save.

Level: 9
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 round/3 levels
Area of effect: Self

This spell enables the wizard to conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light to surround him. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum, seven of which have distinct powers and purposes. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blinded for 2d4 turns by the colors of the sphere. Only the spellcaster can pass in and out of the prismatic sphere without harm, though he can cast it over others to protect them. Any creature passing through the barrier receives the effect of several colors. The following table shows the colors and effects of the prismatic sphere, as well as what will negate each globe.

Note that typically the upper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as the spellcaster is at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually hidden by the floor surface he is standing on.

Prismatic Sphere Effects:
Color	Order	Effect of Color, Spell Negated By
--------------------------------------------------
Red	1st	inflicts 20 points of damage, save for half

Orange	2nd	inflicts 40 points of damage, save for half

Yellow	3rd	inflicts 80 points of damage, save for half

Green	4th	save vs. poison or die, survivors suffer
                20 points of damage

Blue	5th	save vs. petrification or turn to stone

Indigo	6th	save vs. wand or go insane

Violet	7th	save vs. spell or be sent to another plane~

Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

A mass charm spell affects either persons or monsters just as a charm person or charm monster spell. The mass charm spell, however, affects a number of creatures whose combined levels of experience or Hit Dice does not exceed twice the level of experience of the spellcaster. All affected creatures must be within the spell range and within a 30-feet cube. Note that the creatures' saving throws are unaffected by the number of recipients (see the charm person and charm monster spells), but all target creatures are subject to a penalty of -2 on their saving throws because of the efficiency and power of this spell. The Wisdom bonus against charm spells does apply.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a glowing orb of pure power that surrounds the caster and moves with him. It protects the caster from incoming spells, in varying degrees depending on the caster's level:
Level 12 - The orb makes level 3 spells totally useless when cast at the mage
Level 16 - The orb makes level 4 spells totally useless when cast at the mage
Level 20 - The orb makes level 5 spells totally useless when cast at the mage
Level 24 - The orb makes level 6 spells totally useless when cast at the mage

The orb does not protect the caster against spells of any level higher than 6.~

@20513 = ~Globe Of Darkness (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 8
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 2 creatures
Saving Throw: None

This is the spell that was heavily used in the Drow ranks of Menzoberranzan on the underdark foe. The spell never blinds the target but does create a short lived globe of utter darkness over the target. The globe is totally dark and totally hinders the sight of he who stands in it. The spell always works but is short lived as it only fools the target for 4 rounds. In this time though he will suffer a 10 THAC0 penalty and will loose 5 points to his armour class.~
@20514 = ~Blinded~
@20515 = ~Instant Army~
@20516 = ~Instant Army (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 9
Range: 5 Yards
Duration: 2 turns per level
Casting Time: 10

By means of this spell, the caster is able to create an instant army, which rises from the ground in the form of earth, stone or sand soldiers.

The caster can summon one unit of 2 soldiers for every four levels he possesses (round all fractions down) up to 8 soldiers at level 16. The units must appear within a 250-feet radius, placed as the caster sees fit. When the spell duration expires, the surviving units vanish. At the base caster level, this means 40 soldiers will be created for 6 hours.

Soldier: AC 4; MV 3; HD 2; THAC0 19; #AT 1; Damage 1d6+2; SD +1 or better weapon to hit; MR 20%.
They are immune to all enchantment/charm spell; they serve only the summoner.~
@20517 = ~Create Minion~
@20518 = ~Create Minion (Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: 10 Yards
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 10

This spell is used in conjunction with confer in order to create a quasimancer. When the minion is created, a corporeal undead minion is animated and reinstated with a portion of its former life essence, giving it artificial intelligence and spellcasting potential. In terms of physical traits, the minion becomes a wight, having all the abilities and statistics of that creature .

The minion is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (as a 5 Hit Dice creature) to avoid falling under control of the caster. If it succeeds, it will do its best to escape and then go on a killing spree, resentful of the knowledge that its time of existence is limited. (Some created minions may try to find a wizard and force him to cast permanency upon them, thus negating the 1-20 days expiration of the spell.) If it fails, it falls under complete control of the caster and can act as its master's agent in the field. Its intelligence allows it to command other undead in its master's name, and it remains susceptible to the confer spell.

Created minions under control make all saving throws at the level of their master; they are immune to charm, sleep, enfeeblement, polymorph, electricity, insanity, cold, and death spell; they exude a fear aura, 5-feet radius, requiring a successful save vs. spell or flee for 2d4 rounds.

A living person subjected to this spell must make a successful save vs. death magic or die, becoming a created minion and entitled to the saving throw as detailed above.

The material components of this spell are the body to be raised and a bit of brain matter.~
@20519 = ~Black Mantle~
@20520 = ~Black Mantle (Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: Self
Duration: 1 round/4 levels
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: all within 3 yards
Saving Throw: Neg

The Black Mantle spell creates a shimmering aura around the caster. The aura negates all healing and regeneration while the spell effect lasts so hitting the caster with this dark blanket is unwise. For instance, a potion of healing has no effect on a creature under the influence of a Black Mantle spell, a troll cannot regenerate lost hit points, and cure light wounds spell or staff of curing is useless.

If the saving throw is failed, the creature is affected for 1 turn per level of the caster. If the creature is still alive at the end of the spell's duration, any active curative forces will operate normally; for instance, a ring of regeneration resumes its function. Healing magic applied after the spell wears off works normally.

The material component for this spell is a small mummified animal, such as a mouse or a toad.~

This spell summons a pair of shimmering violet phantom beings that will stay on either side of the wizard and protect him from all attackers.

The shield maidens stay close enough to the caster for their shields to help cover the wizard. The shield of one maiden will provide the caster with a +1 Armor Class bonus. While the shield maidens can protect the caster from attacks from different directions, they will move no farther than 50 feet away from the caster, even if the wizard orders them to move away. They follow magically wherever the caster goes.~

This spell summons a powerful genie that has a direct link to the gods above. The genie will perform a deed for the caster that will prove fateful for the weak races of the lands. The genie will ask and the caster will tell him to eradicate every creature belonging to one weak race in the current area of visual range. Upon his quick cast the deed is done and a whole race drops to a silent death one by one with no chance of a save.~
@20526 = ~Animate Golem~
@20527 = ~Animate Golem (Necromancy)
Level: 9
Casting Time: 10
Duration: Until slain

This spell can be cast on any being that actually has a body. The creature chosen and subjected to the spell must save vs death or fall dead as the life is sucked in to the commanding power of the wizard. Shortly after his body parts will animate a flesh golem with varying strength and hit points. The hit points that the golem has depends on the creature that was used to create the beast. The beast will have the same hit points as the slain being and a THAC0 of 4 with 1.5 attacks per round.~

This spell creates an immobile glittering disk of energy of any colour chosen by the caster. All creatures passing through the screen are attacked by a multitude of razor-sharp blades made of substance drawn from the Quasi-Plane of Mineral. Each creature suffers 3d20 points of damage no matter what its Armor Class.~
@20532 = ~Khelben's Blackstaff~
@20533 = ~Khelben's Blackstaff (Alteration)
Level: 9
Range: Self
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: None 

This is the unique spell that gave its creator, the archmage Khelben Arunsun Waterdeep, his nickname. The magic causes any non-magical staff, club, piece of wood, or polearm held by the caster to shimmer with a black, crawling radiance.

A weapon enchanted with Khelben's Blackstaff has the following properties:

* It can never harm the caster or any other beings touching the staff during the casting of the spell

@20541 = ~Wall of White Magic (Evocation, Alteration)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None 

This is very much a form of white magic when the damaging effects are accounted for. The mage casts his dweomer and a wall of blinding white flame raise to hum his body. The curtain does nothing for protection physically but it is an unpredictable casting machine. Any enemy that comes to melee range and strikes to caster while the wall is raised can be struck with any of the following spells. The spell that is cast is totally random and in some cases can be a hindrance to the caster as it may aid the attacker.
Spells:
Magic Missile
Burning Hands
Lightning Bolt
Cone Of Cold
Melf Acid Arrow
Flame Arrow
Stone Skin
Improved Haste
Mirror Image
Spirit Armour

The spell is most unpredictable indeed but with more harming effects than aiding it can help when surrounded and if you damage yourself the effects can pass over to yourself.~

@20706 = ~Greater Dispelling~
@20707 = ~Greater Dispelling (Abjuration)
Level: 6
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-feet cube
Saving Throw: Special

A casting of Greater Dispelling removes magical effects upon anyone within the area of effect.  This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. Also, unlike a regular forms of dispelling, this spell will also remove defensive magical effects such as stone skin, elemental protection, or magical armors and mantles.  It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%.  For every level that the caster of the dispel magic is above the original caster, his chance of success increases by 5%.  For every level that the caster of dispel magic is below the original caster, his chance of success decreases by 10%.  However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure.  Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success.  Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note:  while this spell dispels the individual effects of grease, web, stinking cloud and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

During this time, the caster's body is hidden and extremely weak - his Hit Points are reduced to a minimum, but when his spirit re-enters his body, his health will be restored to 100% as part of the dominated creature's soul is carried back with him/her.

The combinations are as follows:
  1 6th, 7th, 8th level spell
  1 7th, 8th and 9th level spell
  2 level 8 spells
  2 level 9 spells
  3 1st and 2nd level spells~

@20943 = ~Cat's Grace (Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 1 creature
Duration: 6 turns per level at levels 8-16
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Target Selected
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the recipient a boost to his dexterity score. The spell will grant a random bonus from 1-4 which will stay with the recipient for 6 turns per level of the caster which takes effect through levels 8-16 with a max duration of 48 turns.~
@20944 = ~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles~
@20945 = ~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles (Evocation) 
Level: 4
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None vs missile (save vs spells negates bonus concussive damage)

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy, which streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The target must be seen or otherwise detected.

The wizard creates one missile at 7th level, and an additional missile at every third level after 7th--in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level.

Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of impact damage upon the target creature, and then bursts in a concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster to all within a 3 feet radius. For example, a 12th level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of damage. A target creature that makes a successful saving throw vs. spell negates the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no saving throw. If at a level where the caster projects 7 missiles (lv25) and the target fails save 7 times (very unlikely a powerful foe will fail save even once let alone 7 times) the hit can cause an immense max of around 231 hit points of damage.~

@20969 = ~The rapier is a light weapon with a straight, double-edged, pointed blade. It is designed to be a light, thrusting sword. The term rapier is often used to describe a civilian weapon, as opposed to the heavier and deadlier swords of soldiers and mercenaries. Rapiers are fashionable among nobles and gentlemen.

As a new art of fighting evolved with emphasis on thrusting with the blade as opposed to slashing, a new weapon was required. This art is known as fencing, and it requires a rapier. As the sport grew in popularity, the rapier was required to be narrower and lighter. It became not a slashing weapon at all, but a weapon purely for thrusting.

The early rapier handles have straight quillons (cross guards), side guards, and knuckle bows. The later versions have shell guards, similar to the basket hilts of the broad sword and cutlass. As a result, the rapier wielder enjoys the same Parry and punching bonuses outlined earlier.

Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness.  Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safe-keeping.  The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear.  Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest.  His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost Drowned.  All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched or tried to escape.

In battle, it draws the wielder's hand to slash through his opponents' vitals, rending and tearing into nerves, tendons, windpipes, veins and arteries alike, and somehow hardens its owner's body as well. Jerias met his doom at the mauling fists of a berserk Clay Golem. The Talons' new captain gambled the weapon away soon afterwards. Interestingly, the company's decline was quick to follow.

All was going well until there was a disruption in the spells of the group. Turmoil ensued, and many of the group were lost to the mystery of the magic.

  Two emerged from the chaos: Potencius, an archmage of great renown, and Minto, one of the strongest fighters and mages in all the land. The two realized that the conjuration contrived by the original Council of Mystra was no longer an option, and so went about things in their own way.

  The two went into seclusion for many months, plotting and planning the new conjuration. Eventually, after bypassing many hardships endured during the making, the spells were finished, and the final product was almost ready.

  Others in high standing were informed of the results of Minto and Potencius' work, and were more than eager to see it perfected. Together, they worked until it was near perfect and ready for the release to the villagers.

  On the day of release, dark magic scattered about the product, magical particles flying every which way. It was time for the ritual and final casting A mistake was made in the incantations.

A good guess would be this is all that remains of Tobeir d'Aphalil, an infamously rush paladin from Suzail. Young and fervent, Tobeir became obsessed with cleansing the Multiverse of fiends after he had seen his sister, also a paladin, torn apart by an escaped Glabrezu. Not satisfied with slaying demons just in Faerun, Tobeir has led an expedition of other hotheads into the very depths of the Abyss. This happened five years ago, and the group hasn't been heard from ever since. How Tobeir survived all those years and what terrible fate he had finally met with will, most likely, never be known.

Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away.  This ivory-headed mace was the result.  The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory.  Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place.  The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace.  It is carved from pure ivory and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon.  The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.

Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace.  It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater.  The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold.  Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest.  Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

The hamlet encircled by cliffs, searching for her lair proved hopeless, and no adventurer wished to have anything to do with a "midget bloodsucker". Laughing, they would move on and leave the funny little people to their worries. The desperate halflings burned the bodies of Benjara's victims so they would escape her fate, and a pillar of smoke and ashes now always swayed over the village. The inhabitants' numbers dwindled.

One morning, Benjara's own sister, Amenin, came to the priest of Yondalla, who has been powerless to help, and showed him bite marks on her neck. "Look," she said. "My little sister paid me a visit this night. We can't rely on your goddess to intervene, or on adventurers, but I will not go without a fight." With these words, she gave the priest a small knife stained with something dark. "Somehow, I wounded her. Her blood is on the blade. Ask your goddess for a blessing, so we can find Benjara with it." The priest disappeared behind curtains and when he returned, the knife was glowing faintly.

Gathering the villagers, Amenin tossed the knife up in the air. It didn't fall, but hovered and spun around like a vane, showing the way. Following the weapon, the halflings found Benjara's hideout when the sun was about to set. Amenin had to slay her own sister and, though the nightmare was over, she soon traded the knife away, hating its sight. The weapon is most effective when thrown, seeking out opponents' blood relentlessly, but performs well in melee as well.

This was the lesson Rosheila the druid learned when her grove on the northern slopes of the Cloudpeak Mountains had gotten in the way of an orcish invasion in 1282 DR. At the time only 18, Rosheila mourned the loss of her kind mentor Ellageri, passed away earlier that summer. Rosheila didn't have anyone more dear to her than Ellageri. Depressed, she questioned her beliefs. "What is the point of caring for these trees and bears, and worshipping the sky, and tending the sacred pools if those we know still abandon us?" she would ask herself, sitting by the older woman's grave. "I'm wasting my time here."

She was about to abandon the grove, when first reports trickled in of a large orcish horde gone off the peaks and heading north. There was little hope the orcs wouldn't stop by to desolate the grove, believing the druids to be spies for Nashkel below. Because of her condition, Rosheila was left to tend the grove, while every other druid left to fend off the orcs. Alas, luck was not on their side and most of them perished. When Rosheila saw columns of orcs snaking down, she realized what had happened and had no more will to live. Determined to die but take the orcs with her, she called upon powers beyond her ability, summoning a landslide that swept away the orcs. 

With boulders falling all around her, Rosheila took one last look at the world, when suddenly she felt someone take her hand. Ellageri's vague form quietly smiled to her, and Rosheila felt herself become light as a feather, immaterial, and saw the rain of stones go on right through her, causing no harm. When it was over, Ellageri vanished, still without a word. The grove was saved and eventually restored. Rosheila, now certain she was not alone, grew up to become an Arch Druid. Necklaces such as this were made by her apprentices to be used in meditations on immortality, and imbued with some magic as well.

In cities, streets were frozen white and finding shelter became the matter of life and death. Yet in the wilderness winter raged harder still. A small village high up the Spine of the World had been cut off by snowfalls and avalanches. For three months, the highlanders were silent and presumed dead by those below. When the uncertain Mirtul brought in some sunshine and Auril the Frostmaiden began her dignified retreat, a merchant climbed up the slopes, resolved to either trade with the villagers or, in the worst case, search the hamlet for valuables winter had spared.

How surprised was he to find the village living as usual! Not only did the highlanders survive the great winter, they even found an alternative to steel weapons and tools, easily shattered in the cold. Using unknown magic, they would enchant ice items to give them edge, sturdiness and the ability to withstand the warmth indoors. Curious, the merchant bought an axe of that kind, eventually selling it to a weapons collector. The axe had seen many museums since, most recently the Hall of Wonders in Baldur's Gate. The Hall is known for not selling its items, so the weapon's appearance in Copper Coronet is probably less than legal.

Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate.  The name of the warrior and a one word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask.  The helm was then left in the dead warrior's funeral pyre.  The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man's fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos.  After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests.  Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals.  According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear.  This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe".

During the gods' war, Tzu-Jin banished the nightlord Hattsu and his Hannya consort, incurring the wrath of the powerful allies in the Konishi ninja clan. Consequently, Tzu-Jin was hunted by the goddess Chirasu, patron of the clan Konishi. The two gods met at Itzuhachi, where Tzu-Jin, badly wounded, was able to escape only with the help of his nephew, Hachiman. Such was the severity of his wounds incurred by Tzu-Jin at the hands of Chirasu. The moon god has yet to recover his former strength. Furthermore, during battle, Tzu-Jin was forced to relinquish his sword, Tuki Kiba, the Moon Fang. After the gods' war, Chirasu entrusted Tuki Kiba to Lao-Zhu, head of clan Konishi. The recent history of the Moon Fang and how it came to be in the possession of Kojiro Sasaki is shrouded in mystery. Much of the power of Tuki Kiba is derived from the moon. Consequently, its powers are much diminished in daylight.

To that end, he had his warrior-priests fashion three weapons of power: a sword, a spear and a bow. Only Toril's best warriors could ever hope to wield those weapons, and... Alas, here the runes become completely indecipherable, and the rest of the story is lost.

History:

The Staff of Law was forged by Berek Halfhand, Earthfriend, Lord Fatherer, Seer, and Prophet in a time when the entire land was One Forest, and humans were one and the same with their surroundings.

Berek made the staff from a branch of the One Tree, metal shods imbued with Earthpower, and the knowledge that this staff would help preserve the Law of the Land.

When the day came that Berek died, the Staff of Law was passed on to his son, Kevin. Kevin, in the centuries that he lived, became the most powerful and wise lord in history. With the Staff of Law in his possession, it was believed that all was good and nothing could go wrong. But ever so slowly, Corruption, Lord Foul The Despiser, crept into Kevin's life. Lord Foul disguised himself as one of the Lords and won Kevin's friendship. The Despiser then provoked him into performing the Ritual of Desecration; this Ritual being perhaps the most heinous act one could commit against the land. Rather than see the land he loved corrupted, Kevin agreed. The combination of Lord Foul and the Staff of Law made for a Ritual of Desecration greater than any other before, destroying and altering a large portion of the land. Kevin died during the Ritual, and the staff was believed to be lost forever. Kevin was renamed by those of later generations: Landwaster.

Millennia later, the staff fell into the hands of a demented Cavewight. He used it to alter the weather for his own (or Lord Foul's) ambitions. Thomas Covenant retrieved the Staff of Law from the Cavewight, killing him in the process, and returned it to Revelstone. It rested there for 47 years.

The next to wield it was the High Lord Elena in the fight against Lord Foul. She was believed by many to be the most righteous Lord since Kevin Landwaster. However, both corruption and an unearthly malice took root within her. In looking for a way to kill Foul, she summoned dead Kevin, told him to fight and defeat the Despiser. Kevin was easily mastered with the Illearth Stone and was sent back to decimate High Lord Elena. A great battle raged on for days; Kevin could not be killed for he was already dead. And Elena... Elena was preserved only by her will and the pure power of the Staff of Law. Eventually, though, a sonic boom resounded through the land. Elena was dead and the Staff of Law destroyed along with her.

The heels of the Staff of Law were later found by one Urvile named Vain. With the help of the Elohim, Findail, the new Staff of Law, which you now possess, was forged.

How it came to rest in this part of the world, however, is unknown to you.

Many Amnish armorsmiths would give an eye for the know-how of this process, but their Kara-Tur counterparts guard the secret closely. The suit, meant for a noble samurai, honor-bound warrior of Kara-Tur, appears large and unwieldy. Once put on, however, it actually adds to the wearer's agility somewhat. How any samurai equipment could make it from so far away to Amn is anyone's guess. Still, recent rumors speak of a nameless samurai come to Athkatla on a mission, ambushed by slavers and killed fighting, his gear subsequently sold.

@21327 = ~Sapphire Mace~

The jewel is an eye-catching and intense blue, though its depths are slightly clouded. Faint veils seem to shift and twist like smoke within when the stone is studied intently. The sinews of some exotic beast twine around the sapphire, enchanted to hold it tightly in place.

The mace was brought back to Amn by one Ethan, a soldier and worshipper of Helm. He returned to the City of Coin as the last survivor of his unit. The mace was quietly donated to the church, and Ethan himself became a postulant of Ilmater soon afterwards; he never explained the details of Sapphire's capture, but whispered speculation held that the massive gem making up the weapon's business end would cloud the mind of those who looked into it too long.

Careful testing and translation have unlocked some of the secrets of the mace's enchantment. It provides some additional protection from elemental damage, appropriate to a weapon once wielded by a half-naked savage. The craftsmanship is so superior that the weapon seems nearly like an extension of the arm; its unusual composition makes it preternaturally light and swift.

All affected creatures must be within the spell range and within a 30-feet cube. Note that the creatures' saving throws are unaffected by the number of recipients (see the charm person and charm monster spells), but all target creatures are subject to a penalty of -2 on their saving throws because of the efficiency and power of this spell.

This spell creates a glowing orb of pure power that surrounds the caster and moves with him. It protects the caster from incoming spells, in varying degrees depending on the caster's level:
Level 12 - The orb makes level 3 spells totally useless when cast at the mage
Level 16 - The orb makes level 4 spells totally useless when cast at the mage

The staff is grey to the degree that the looker for a moment forgets the very idea of vivacity, and has no weight. Careful investigation reveals it to be the shade equivalent of a Staff of Fire, though here, too, the relation is far from precise: instead of summoning Fire Elementals and controlling other igneous forces, it may cause the victim to burst into shadow flames.

Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen.  On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave.  He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him.  The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle.  When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request.  He wanted to keep them as servants.  The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden.  They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him.  Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life.  The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across.  His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood.  The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp.  When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

@21474 = ~bladesinger~

@21475 = ~BLADESINGER:
  The Bladesinger is a highly admired elven warrior who, from youth, chooses a particular type of bladed, one-handed weapon, and concentrates all his effort upon learning and mastering it. This, however, detracts from other traditional warrior skills. This unique focus on a single weapon allows the bladesinger to parry attacks, and this, combined with his famous ability to cast several low level mage spells and his increased reaction rate, makes the Bladesinger a foe to be reckoned with in combat. Also, spell casting in melee combat can be achieved during a period of parrying. His spell casting is a huge advantage, but his casting time is slightly slower than that of a pure mage.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can achieve Grand Mastery with any 1-handed blade-type weapon category
-  Gains Mage spells from level 8 and above
-  Gains +2 to AC at level 16
-  Gains +2 to THAC0 at level 16
-  Receives a permanent +1 damage modifier
-  Has the ability to Disarm four times per day (This allows to knock the target's weapon out of its hands if an attack at -5 is successful and if the target fails a save vs death at -5. Disarming can be attempted for 2 rounds per use of the ability.)
-  Gains a special Parrying move at levels 2, 7, 10 and 13

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be Elven
-  Wears no armour greater than Studded Leather or Elven Chain
-  Has fighting skills in 1-handed weapon style only, as is traditional of the Bladesinger

  The Frost Dwellers are members of a barbaric tribe that live in the icy peaks of the Ten Towns region. Being raised in such hostile conditions has given them the ability to resist sub-zero temperatures, as well as increasing their lung capacity. However, they are anti-social, and not greatly intelligent. They are also less apt at learning new skills - while they are proficient with some weapons, they will be clumsy when wielding any that were not available to them during their upbringing.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has 25% resistance to cold, which increases to 50% at level 14, 75% at 18, and 100% at level 22
-  Receives +1 to maximum Constitution
-  Gains innate ability to cast Freezing Sphere at lvl 12, 15, and 18

@21481 = ~vampire hunter~

@21482 = ~VAMPIRE HUNTER:
  The Vampire Hunter has been raised from birth to hunt down and slay the demons of the night. He is driven by an insatiable hatred for the undead, and his loathing of this abomination of life gives him exceptional combat bonuses against vampires and their kin. His long exposure to vampires has made their life-draining attacks innocuous to him. The very nature of this profession demands extraordinary endurance; all vampire slayers gain a bonus to their constitution as a result of their outstanding stamina. 
  The long and arduous training with piercing weapons (which are the most effective against the undead) which they are forced to undergo leaves them with little time to hone their skills in other areas. As a result of this, the Vampire Hunter is only able to achieve Grand Mastery with weapons that deliver piercing damage. It is a prerequisite of vampire slaying that the candidate be of a good alignment.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Immune to Level-Draining attacks and effects
-  Receives +3 to THAC0 and +3 to damage against undead creatures
-  Gains innate ability to Create Shadows at levels 1, 10, 14, and 18 (This ability causes Vampire Hunter to blend into the surroundings and disappear, and is similar to the Improved Invisibility spell)
-  Receives +1 to maximum Constitution
-  Can create a stake weapon at levels 10, 12, 14 and 16 (This weapon lasts for 4 rounds and has a 25% chance of slaying a vampire on a successful hit. It deals out 1D10+2 damage)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Can only achieve Grand Mastery with piercing weapons; all other weapon types are limited to 3 proficiency slots maximum
-  Requires 17 Strength and Constitution
-  Cannot Dual Class
-  Must be of Good alignment~

@214850 = ~Marksman~
@21486 = ~MARKSMAN:
  The Marksman is a true master of the bow and the arrow because he has concentrated the vast majority of his efforts toward this since youth. He excels in creating his own special arrows which cause various different effects to the target, such as blinding, poisoning, stunning, or even slaying them instantly. Moreover, his already considerable skills increase dramatically with time, and at the zenith of his experience, he can weave fantastically powerful enchantments into an ordinary bow to devastating effect. One of the more famous of the Marksman's abilities is to shoot at a target with deadly force at almost point-blank range; rather than close enemies being a handicap to him, as with most ranged attackers, the Marksman revels in this, dealing significant damage to a close target. However, assuming the target is still alive after this deadly shot, the Marksman must change to melee weapons to finish his enemy off. The Marksman's lifestyle demands that he is strong of body and extremely agile. This, combined with his god-like skill with the bow, serves to make him an unstoppable force on the field of battle.
  However, his intense training has left the Marksman with little experience in melee weapons, and his style of attacking demands that he cannot be hindered by any armour. Also, only the most dedicated followers of the light amongst the Elven race may become a Marksman, for they would never use their skills against innocents, for evil, or for malicious ends.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can create a Heart Shot arrow (target dies instantly if it fails a Save vs. Death) at levels 12 and 16
-  Can create a Venom Shot (target is inflicted with a fast-acting poison for 3 rounds if it fails a Save vs. Poison) at levels 1, 10 and 13
-  Can create a Mace Shot (target is blinded for 5 rounds and receives a -6 penalty to its THAC0, effects last for 3 rounds, no Saving Throw) at levels 1, 11 and 14
-  Receives a +1 bonus to THAC0 and damage when using ranged weapons several times as he gains experience
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour
-  Requires 19 Dexterity and 15 Strength
-  Can devote only 2 slots to non-missile weapons
-  Can only gain slots in Single Weapon style
-  Must be an Elf~

@21488 = ~Mace Shot~
@21489 = ~Arrows~
@21490 = ~This arrow will strike the heart of the target and, if a save vs death fails, will kill the target instantly.~
@21491 = ~This arrow will poison the target with a rapid venom for 3 rounds.~
@21492 = ~This shot hits a target and covers it with a mace substance that lowers target's THAC0 by 6 and blinds the target with no save.~
@21493 = ~sellsword~
@214930 = ~Sellsword~
@21494 = ~SELLSWORD:
  The Sellsword is a mercenary who hires out his services to the highest bidder. Inevitably, this sort of lifestyle involves a great deal of violence and physical exertion. Superhuman strength and stamina are vital characteristics for the Sellsword. As a result, his frame dwarfs that of the average human. His enormous strength is evocative of the might of the Cloud Giants, and allows him to perform extraordinary feats of valour in combat. Unfortunately, due to his enormous size, the Sellsword's manoeuvrability suffers, and his agility and dexterity are penalized. Due to his outstanding physical prowess, the Sellsword concentrates exclusively on the use of 2-handed weapons. His tremendous size grants the Sellsword a natural armour class bonus, which increases as he gains more experience. Furthermore, this allows him to withstand damage from crushing and slashing weapons to some degree. Only humans and half-orcs possess the necessary strength and constitution to become Sellswords.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains +1 to AC at levels 13 and 16
-  Gains +1 to THAC0 at levels 1, 13, and 16
-  Receives 25% resistance to Slashing and Crushing damage
-  Receives +1 to maximum Strength

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Can only gain proficiency slots in 2-Handed Weapon style
-  Receives -3 to maximum Dexterity
-  Must be a Human or Half-Orc~
@21495 = ~grunt~
@214950 = ~Grunt~
@21496 = ~GRUNT:
  Grunts are Half-Orcs with many more orc characteristics in them than most others that share their heritage. They are probably one of the least intelligent and repulsive humanoids one may meet, and are hardly to communicate in Common; if they do speak, it is usually emitted in the form of barely audible mumblings, more likely to frustrate a listener than to convey meaning. This leads to other humanoids dismissing them as the equivalent of semi-sentient animals, an assumption that some do not live to regret.
  What Grunts lack in social skills, they more than make up for in the heat of battle. They are often referred to as living siege engines, their abnormally thick skin and outstanding endurance allowing them to withstand the strongest of blows. Grunts are just as impressive on the offensive as on the defensive, as is realized amidst agony by those foolhardy enough to comment on their lack of intellect.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains 1 extra HP per level from levels 10 to 30
-  Receives +1 to maximum Strength
-  Receives +1 to maximum Constitution
-  Has 40% resistance to Crushing damage

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour heavier than Splint Mail
-  Receives -1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Receives -10 to maximum Charisma
-  Must be of Chaotic alignment
-  Must be a Half-Orc
-  Can only have 2 slots in any weapon proficiency~
@21497 = ~pit fighter~
@214970 = ~Pit Fighter~
@21498 = ~PIT FIGHTER:
  These hardened gladiators have honed their combat skills and endurance in the vicious fighting pits found in the seedier parts of Faerun. Years of brutal fighting and rigorous training have improved their stamina, giving them a considerable boost to their constitution. Exposure to such constant violence has hardened the bodies of these embittered warriors to the point where they are able to recover from wounds at a rate far beyond that of a normal human being. The gladiatorial arenas have taught the Pit Fighters not only the need for strength and endurance, but also the importance of speed and agility. As a result, Pit Fighters can move and strike faster than an ordinary adventurer. Only the very best fighters survive past their first few brutal fights. These extraordinary men eventually gain the ability to Cause Serious Wounds on their opponents through sheer force of will.
  However, only humans, dwarves and half-orcs have the physical potential to become Pit Fighters, who are chosen among those with outstanding strength, stamina and agility. Whilst Pit Fighters are brutal warriors, they are rarely given the opportunity to hone their skill with any one weapon, being forced to train and fight with whatever instrument is nearby. As a result, Pit Fighters may only become proficient in Two Weapon Style and Sword and Shield Style. Similarly, due to their lack of familiarity with ranged weapons in the arena, Pit Fighters are unable to use them in combat. Because agility is a fundamental attribute of Pit Fighters, they are unable to wear full plate armour which is far too restrictive to their fighting style.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Regenerates slowly
-  Has a naturally high movement rate
-  Gains Cure Serious Wounds at levels 1 and 12

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Requires 16 Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
-  Must be a Human, Half-Orc, or Dwarf
-  Can only be proficient with Sword and Shield Style or Two Weapon Style
-  Wears no armour heavier than Splint Mail
-  Does not use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Can only place up to 3 proficiency points in a single weapon proficiency
-  Cannot be of Lawful Good alignment~
@21499 = ~duergar warrior~
@214990 = ~Duergar Warrior~
@21500 = ~DUERGAR WARRIOR:
  The Duergar are a race of evil dwarves who have chaos and violence infused into their very being. This, combined with a far greater penalty to Charisma than dwarves normally have, make duergar unsurprisingly poor conversationalists ("Kill them all!" are the only words they are normally able to muster). And, as a result, the majority of races hate Duergar. The odd Duergar is spotted on the surface, but as with Drow, they are usually killed quickly or driven back to their Underdark fortresses, where they constantly war with other dwarves, Drow, and other foul denizens of the Underdark.
  Nevertheless, Duergar are undeniably warriors of the first order, having high constitution as well as excellent training in the Sword and Shield fighting style, though they are poor with the use of ranged weapons. However, most dreaded of all is their ability to dramatically increase their fighting skills for a short while, making their attacks almost impossible to repel.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +1 to maximum Constitution
-  Gains Offensive Rush at levels 1, 12, and 16 (a large increase in number of attacks per round for 3 rounds)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be of Evil alignment
-  Must be a Dwarf
-  Uses only warhammers, axes and maces with any skill
-  Receives -6 to maximum Charisma
-  Can only devote 1 proficiency slot to ranged weapons~
@21501 = ~Offensive Rush~
@21502 = ~guardian~
@215020 = ~Guardian~
@21503 = ~GUARDIAN: 
  The Guardian is a warrior who is hired to protect artifacts and buildings, although an occasional rich noble will hire them as personal bodyguards, a task which they perform exceptionally well. Guardians are very well rounded fighters, though they cannot use two-handed weapons and can only use the crossbow as a ranged weapon. However, this is more than compensated for by their aptitude in the Sword and Shield technique, and they are very proficient in avoiding physical attacks, especially missile ones.
  The profession of Guardian does not require much in the way of brains, which is quite fortunate since they are not particularly well endowed in that department.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains +2 to AC bonus at level 12
-  Has +2 to AC bonus vs missiles

DISADVANTAGES
-  Is not proficient with 2-handed weapons
-  Cannot gain skill in ranged weapons other than crossbows
-  Receives -2 to maximum Intelligence
-  Cannot be of a Chaotic alignment
-  Must be a Human or Dwarf~
@21504 = ~ravager~
@215040 = ~Ravager~
@21505 = ~RAVAGER:
  The aptly named Ravagers are the hunters and defenders of Gnomish villages. These unusually (for Gnomes, at least) vicious fighters are raised from birth to defend the homes and lives of their fellow Gnomes. The constant training and difficult conditions bestow upon them extraordinary endurance alien to the gnomish race. Many an unwary traveller has been surprised by a band of roving gnomish Ravagers who display fighting skills far beyond those of the average Gnome. The most proficient ravagers gain an innate berserk ability which allows them to withstand great hardships and inflict tremendous amounts of damage on those who are foolish enough to stand in their way.
  The Ravagers, however, incur a penalty to their Intelligence as a result of forgoing their studies in favour of physical training. They invariably prefer to use blunt weapons, gaining high levels of specialization with the flail, mace, and similar crushing implements. The training of ravagers concentrates exclusively on melee combat and prevents them from being able to use ranged weapons with any sort of success.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +1 to maximum Constitution
-  Gains Barbarian Rage at levels 1, 12, and 15
-  Has a +1 damage and THAC0 bonus

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be a Gnome
-  Receives -1 to maximum Intelligence
-  Is only skilled with blunt weapons
-  Cannot use ranged weapons~
@215050 = ~drow warrior~
@215051 = ~Drow Warrior~
@21506 = ~DROW WARRIOR:
  The Drow Warriors are looked down upon by the elitist nobility of the dark elves. However, the other noble races tremble in fear of these dreaded fighters. Charging into battle clad in adamantite armour, the Drow warrior wields fearsome two-handed weapons that can easily cleave a grow man in two. Their vicious training allows them to far exceed the skill of the average warrior with these weapons. These terrifying warriors bear an innate resistance to magic which grows with their experience and skill. As a result of constant exposure to magical attacks in the vanguard of the Drow forces, they develop immunity to spells faster than their Drow brethren. Through the divine favour of Lolth, her foot soldiers gain the ability to call down unholy fire upon their foes and use the shadows to escape dangerous situations.
  However, the cumbersome armour and bulky weapons which these Drow bear prevent them from using any sort of ranged weapons. Unlike the other Drow, the warriors do not benefit from their inborn agility as it is hampered by the heavy equipment they are forced to bear.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains Burning Hands innate ability at levels 1 and 12
-  Gains Shadow Door innate ability at levels 1 and 12
-  Gains 5% magic resistance per level up to level 10, then they gain 5% every 2 levels up to level 18

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Not proficient with ranged weapons
-  Receives -10 to maximum Charisma
-  Must be of Evil alignment
-  Must be an Elf
-  Can devote only 4 slots, not 5, to all weapons
-  Requires 16 Strength and 10 Intelligence
-  Suffers a -2 THAC0 and AC penalty in the sunlight
-  As a Drow, is often subject to raids from racial enemies~
@21507 = ~drow battle monger~
@215070 = ~Drow Battle Monger~
@21508 = ~DROW BATTLE MONGER:
  These are the wild, fearless, warriors of the Drow ranks. They are barbaric in their fighting mentality and enter into battle with no fear. Even against hopeless odds, these awe-inspiring warriors have never been known to turn and run. They are killing machines pure and true, as well as being extremely fast. They rely on this speed during combat, so they will not wear any armour or aiding garments that can restrict their movement. Moreover, they despise heavy two-handed weapons, and their barbarism considerably limits the level of intellectual development they are able to attain.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives a +2 AC bonus
-  Has a mild speed boost
-  Attack speed increases with experience
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Gains 5% magic resistance per level up to level 10, then 5% every 2 levels up to level 18

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be Chaotic Evil
-  Must be an Elf
-  Wears no armour or bracers
-  Cannot be proficient with 2-handed weapons
-  Receives -2 to maximum Intelligence
-  Receives -10 to maximum Charisma
-  Only proficient with the crossbow as a ranged weapon
-  Suffers a -2 THAC0 and AC penalty in the sunlight
-  As a Drow, is often subject to raids from racial enemies~
@21509 = ~troll slayer~
@215090 = ~Troll Slayer~
@21510 = ~TROLL SLAYER:
  The enmity between dwarves and trolls is famous, born of a racial hatred that stretches back to the dawn of time, when the races of Faerun were created. The Trollslayers are fearsome warriors driven by an insatiable hatred of all trolls, whom they see as a perversion of nature and an abomination of life. As a result, they are fully dedicated to the complete eradication of these fell creatures, and they have devoted countless hours of training to perfect their skills.
  One of the most powerful of the Trollslayers' abilities is the ability to craft a powerful weapon which will deal significant damage to all trolls, knocking them out with one blow. Moreover, their extensive studies of the ugly forms of trolls has gifted them with the ability to strike them more easily and with more damage than other creatures. They also excel in using the sword and shield fighting style, and are able to achieve high levels of skill with this.
  However, the amazing abilities that Trollslayers possess comes at a cost. They cannot use any ranged weapons at all, and have an impaired skill in all other melee weapons than the battle axe, which is their weapon of choice. Trollslayers are inherently Chaotic creatures, though they may be of a Good, Neutral, or Evil alignment. Often Trollslayers proudly tote 'aromatic' necklaces of troll ears as proof of their valor and skill, skill which is denied by none. Trollslayers are, without a doubt, the most ruthless and violent breed of dwarves that exist in the world.

Advantages:
-  Able to forge a weapon at level 10 that can slay or knock out a troll out on impact
-  Can have 5 proficiency slots devoted to the sword and shield style

Disadvantages:
-  Is not proficient with swords
-  Is not proficient with ranged weapons~
@21511 = ~This weapon is heavily enchanted but the effects are only effective against trolls.  Against any other foe the weapon is not effective at all but will slay a troll on impact or beat it badly

STATISTICS:

Damage:  1D4 (+7 vs trolls), 40% chance to slay Trolls
THACO: +7 vs trolls
Damage type:  crushing
Weight: 5
Speed Factor: 2
Proficiency Type: War Hammer
Type:  1-handed
Requires: 9 Strength

Usable By:
 Troll Slayer~
@21512 = ~forest gnome~
@215120 = ~Forest Gnome~
@21513 = ~FOREST GNOME:
  This forest fighter Gnome is not the most effective fighter, but does possess several tricks, which can make up for his fighting deficits, that he has learned from his time in the forests. The Forest Gnome has learned much from his time with nature, and has an affinity with the animals of the forest. He has the ability to use the shadows to hide or stalk his enemies, and is unusually resiliant to spells. He also uses his small frame to his advantage when fighting larger creatures; this increases his movement rate considerably, making him an extremely challenging opponent for larger, more cumbersome creatures.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Receives +1 to maximum Wisdom
-  Can use his Taunt tactic at levels 1, 12, and 16 (This causes him to speed up considerably for 5 rounds, granting him a substantial armour class bonus, which makes him almost unhittable by slower creatures)
-  Can Create Shadows 4 times per day
-  Can Charm Animal 2 times per day

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Receives -1 to maximum Intelligence
-  Can only devote 4 proficiency slots to any weapon
-  Must be a Gnome~
@21514 = ~Taunt~
@21515 = ~breach gnome~
@215150 = ~Breach Gnome~
@21516 = ~BREACH GNOME:
  The Breach Gnome battles at the front line of any gnomish force. Renowned for their furious fighting style, these vicious Gnomes are, without a doubt, the most feared of all gnomish ranks. Clad in extremely bulky armour to protect them from enemy onslaughts, the breach Gnome is able to stand extraordinary amounts of damage and punishment. Trained to fight with a sword and a shield, the breach Gnome excel in this style of combat. Despite the heavy encumbrance of their armour, they are never the superb at shattering all types of defences, magical as well as physical. Their uncanny abilities are supplemented with a select array of penetrating spells which strike fear into the hearts of even the most well-protected spellcasters. Able to crush even the most resilient defences, the power of the breach Gnome is legendary amongst their own folk.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has a +2 THAC0 bonus
-  Gains Breach and Pierce Magic at levels 1 and 14
-  Gains Spellstrike at level 18

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Cannot be of Lawful Neutral, true neutal or Chaotic neutal alignment
-  Can only devote 3 proficiency slots to any weapon
-  Does not use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Does not use swords with any skill
-  Must be a Gnome~
@21517 = ~halfling archer~
@215170 = ~Halfling Archer~
@21518 = ~HALFLING ARCHER:
  The Halfling Archer is very much an all-around fighter, but has developed exceptional proficiency with all bows. His melee combat is as good as any, and despite his racial strength deficit, gains bonus dexterity on top of racial bonuses. With a ranged weapon they gain the ability to inflict more damage and with greater accuracy the more experienced they become. But, as good as they are, they are not nearly as specialized or devoted as a true archer ranger. Because of their need for agaility when using the bow, Halfling Archers never wear heavy armours, and their training with melee weapons has not been as extensive as that of other fighters.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gain +1 THAC0 and damage with ranged weapons at levels 1, 12 and 16
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Can devote a maximum of 3 proficiency slots to melee weapons
-  Requires 14 Dexterity
-  Must be a Halfling~
@21519 = ~tactician~
@215190 = ~Tactician~
@21520 = ~TACTICIAN:
  The Tactician is a warrior that, due to his lack of physical attributes, uses the power of foresight and divination to aid him. They have learned to gain access to divination spells via memory, but such mental training prevents them from perfecting their skills with weapons. Tacticians are often employed by nobles and army leaders before battle to help them plan their strategies; as such, they are greatly respected throughout the Realms, particularly amongst military leaders, in spite of the fact that their combat skills are not as good as those of other fighters.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has access to innate divination spells, gaining 1 per level from levels 8 to 13
-  Can Create Shadows at levels 10 and 14

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Can achieve only 3 proficiency slots in any weapon
-  Requires 12 Intelligence
-  Must be a Gnome of Halfling~
@21521 = ~blademaster~
@215210 = ~Blademaster~
@21522 = ~BLADEMASTER:
  While the Blademaster is of no higher status than a regular fighter, he has learned to specialize in a certain, specific group of weapons in his upbringing. He is an expert in dual-wielding and also has reactions of unmatched speed. He has learned to use this advantage to enter into a state of blind fighting, in which he uses his sense of hearing to attack his enemy, instead of sight. This makes him increasingly open to attacks, but also makes him a far more deadly opponent in melee. The Blademaster's specialisation limits the weapons he is able to use, and his requirement of speed dictates that he will never wear heavy armour.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has a +1 bonus to hit
-  Has a +2 bonus to damage
-  Can enter a state of Blind Fighting at levels 10, 13 and 16 (This state will penalize his AC by 2, but will grant him 25 Dexterity and a +3 THAC0 bonus, for 5 rounds)
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Uses only the following weapons with any skill: Dagger, spear, quarterstaff, longbow, bastard sword, long sword, and 2-handed sword
-  Wears no armour greater than studded leather
-  Must be Human, Halfling or Half-Elf~
@21523 = ~rhythm warrior~
@215230 = ~Rhythm Warrior~
@21524 = ~RHYTHM WARRIOR:
  These are warriors of the pakari, well versed in armed and unarmed combat. They use jumps, feints, dodging and other dexterous manoeuvers to their maximum advantage. When in combat, to an outsider it almost seems that the are fighting to music as they move fluently and to an unheard rhythm. They are a true threat when they have mastered their trade at a high level. Because armour or heavy weapons would hinder the fluid movement of the Rhythm Warrior, they avoid their use; the physical prowess required by their movements is also unusually high.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains +1 to his AC every odd level, up to level 15
-  Gains an extra 1/2 attack every 4 levels, up to level 16
-  Gains increased damage at levels 6, 12 and 15
-  Can Create Shadows twice per day
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour or bracers
-  Only uses the following weapons with any skill: dagger, dart, spear, quarterstaff, sling and short sword
-  Requires 10 Strength, 14 Dexterity, and 12 Constitution
-  Must be Lawful
-  Must be an Elf, Half-Elf or Halfling
-  Rolls 1d8 instead of 1d10 for for hit points~
@21525 = ~vindicator~
@215250 = ~Vindicator~
@21526 = ~VINDICATOR:
  The Vindicator has used his training time to discover and memorize the weaknesses of all undead creatures, to aid him in his unending quest to rid the land of such evil foe. Undead are abominations of nature, and as a result, the Vindicator will be hailed as a hero in almost any good community; their hatred for the undead is unmatched, as is their prowess in destroying them. A Vindicator is capable of creating a weapon, using his skill and knowledge, that is most effective against undead; this represents the pinnacle of the Vindicator's skill, and demonstrates his vast knowledge of the weak points of undead creatures.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has a +1 to hit vs. undead creatures
-  At level 10 is immune to level drain
-  At level 10 is immune to energy drain
-  Can create the Death Reaper blade at level 14 (This is a long sword that causes 1D8 base damage; however, against all undead, it acts as a +12 weapon)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Requires 13 Strength and Dexterity, and 14 Constitution and Wisdom
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Must be of Good alignment
-  Must be a Gnome, Half-Elf or Halfling~
@21527 = ~The Death Reaper~
@21528 = ~This blade is the product off all the Vindicator's knowledge of the undead's weaknesses. As a regular weapon it is a 1D8 but against undead it is a 1D8+12 weapon, it also can slay the undead on strike.

STATISTICS:

Damage: 1D8 +3, +12 vs. undead
THAC0 Bonus: 4

Usable By:
  Vindicator~
@21529 = ~holy fighter~
@215290 = ~Holy Fighter~
@21530 = ~HOLY FIGHTER:
  The Holy Fighters are a branch of believers who are most dedicated to their god, but are destined to carry out the physical, rather than spiritual, tasks of their deities. They have little time to practice their magical abilities, but are familiar with minor aiding spells taught to them by the higher-ranking and more experienced priests of their deity. They are just as proficient with weaponry as a regular fighter, but choose to practice only with the weapons considered acceptable by their order of priesthood; these include all blunt weapons, but excludes bladed weapons. They are bound to a Lawful alignment; they can be devoted to any god but are always Lawful to that god.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can advance to Grand Mastery, but only with weapons usable by clerics
-  Gains Prayer ability at levels 8 and 10
-  Gains Cure Serious Wounds at levels 10 and 14
-  At level 10, gains +2 damage with a weapon of his choice
-  Gains immunity to disease at level 5

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Requires 17 Strength, 14 Constitution, and 14 Wisdom
-  Must be of Lawful alignment
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Must be a Half-Orc~
@21531 = ~Cure Serious Wounds~
@21532 = ~erinyes tiefling~
@215320 = ~Erinyes Tiefling~
@21533 = ~ERINYES TIEFLING:
  This race of Half-elven tieflings are the only type that are known for peaceful behavior, but there are still exceptions. They are well known for their godlike looks. They have pale white skin that glows very faintly and pointed ears. At first, these features grab the attention of onlookers, but they soon discard this feature and are overwhelmed with the Erinyes' beauty. As a small race of tiefling, they do not possess all of the powers that tieflings are known to have, but they are still immensely powerful for their small physical frame. They have a natural strength greater than most races that are socially acceptable in Faerun. Their means of residing in Faerun is unknown; they are part of an extra-planar race, but the fact they are offspring of a Half-elven race may suggest that a passing tiefling from the outer planes was responsible. Despite this race of tiefling being very strong, they have unbelievably soft and delicate skin that is easily bruised and damaged. Their natural constitution therefore suffers. As much as that is an annoyance, they do possess a very unusual skill: the ability to temporarily adapt and evolve a physical attribute to help them in certain situations. In doing this, though, they lose a random skill point from 2 other categories. The temporary sacrifice, however, usually pays off.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Maximum natural Strength of 20
-  Maximum natural Charisma of 20
-  Can release pheromones 3 times per day (Attracts people and gives 25 Charisma for 1 turn)
-  Has 25% resistance to magic
-  At levels 10, 12 and 15 they can adapt their Strength, Dexterity or Constitution for 2 turns (this increases the chosen ability by 2 while penalizing two others by 1)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -1 to maximum Wisdom
-  Receives -1 to maximum Intelligence
-  Receives -1 to maximum Constitution
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Has -2 AC vs slashing weapons
-  Must be a Half-Elf~

@21548 = ~amazon~
@215480 = ~Amazon~
@21549 = ~AMAZON:
  Amazons are female warriors in a male-dominated world. Their civilization may have been created by a deity who likes women, they might have been women who rebelled against male domination and decided to rule themselves, or they might simply have been matriarchal societies from long before recorded history.
  Whatever their origin, they now live in civilizations or communities where women occupy the positions and roles traditionally held by men, especially the role of warriors and adventurers.
  An Amazon culture may be small (a single town or island) or large (an entire country or continent), very advanced or very primitive. Some Amazon cultures keep men as servants and slaves, a stern reversal of the former status; others have no men in their communities, and take long holidays in order to visit friendly neighbouring tribes of men; others perpetuate their kind by being very hospitable to adventurers passing through their territory.
  Amazons are generally respected as highly proficient warriors, their weapons of choice being spears and bows. They also have a knowledge of poisons, and a mild affinity with the natural world. Due to their female status, Amazons are often greatly underestimated, and they are quick to use this, along with any other, advantage in battle.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can poison weapons such as spears at level 10
-  Can charm animals once every 4 levels
-  Can use their female status to an advantage by using First Strike at levels 1, 10 and 14 (This grants them +3 damage and a superb bonus to their THAC0 for the first or second hit)
-  Gain 1D10+1 hit points as opposed to 1D10

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Cannot be of Lawful alignment
-  Can only use spears, swords, axes, clubs and bows with any skill
-  Can obtain Grand Mastery only with spears and the longbow
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Must be a Half-Elf~
@21550 = ~First Strike~
@21551 = ~chanter~
@215510 = ~Chanter~
@21552 = ~CHANTER:
  The Chanter is one of the most unusual of all the bard classes, drawn from one of the many barbarian tribes that inhabit the northern reaches of Faerun. The Chanter is a strange mixture of the Barbarian and the Bard, though he manages to combine the characteristics of both to become an awesome opponent on the field of battle. The Chanter possesses many invaluable skills, particularly the ability to enrage himself, though he can also move much quicker than other creatures and is a very effective fighter. However, the most formidable of all his skills is the ability to grant his party immunity to fear whilst playing his battle song. Moreover, since the Chanter has Barbarian blood coursing through his veins, he is much tougher and more resilient than other Bard classes.
  However, only Humans and Half-Elves possess the necessary attributes to become a Chanter, and because he was never trained as a true warrior with the rest of his tribe, he is unable to use any ranged weapons with any skill. Also, the Chanter must be strong of arm and body to survive, and his training in weapons and battle skills has left him with a lesser skill in Lore and Pickpocketing than other Bard classes.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can be of any alignment
-  Has a natural movement speed bonus
-  Gains Barbarian Rage at levels 1, 13, and 18
-  Sings the Bard Song "Tales of Curran Strongheart", which grants immunity to fear, rigid thinking and feeblemindedness, and additional bonuses at higher experience levels

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Cannot use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Uses only certain weapons in which he was trained with any skill
-  Requires 15 Strength~
@21553 = ~chronicler~
@215530 = ~Chronicler~
@21554 = ~CHRONICLER:
  The Chronicler is a Bard with a taste for adventure and battle. He has the ability to aid his companions in battle with his famous war chant; it said that those under the influence of the Chronicler's chant are transformed into mighty fighting machines, gaining significant combat bonuses. The Chronicler is also a useful fighter himself, since the lifestyle he has chosen has led to a far greater proficiency in combat than other Bard classes. However, due to this combat-orientated lifestyle, the Chronicler is far less capable at picking pockets than a common Bard.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives a +1 bonus to THAC0 and +1 bonus to damage with all weapons
-  Sings the "War Chant of Syth" Bard Song (this song grants 10% resistance to Slashing, Crushing, Piercing and Missile damage as well as a +2 AC bonus. It also regenerates allies of 1 HP per round. These bonuses improve as the Chronicler achieves higher experience levels)
-  Can use True Seeing three times a day
-  Receives +1 to maximum Constitution
-  Can devote 2 proficiency slots to Swords and Axes

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Requires 15 Strength and Constitution
-  Receives only 1/4 of pickpocketing skill compared to a normal Bard
-  Receives -1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Cannot use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Must be of Chaotic alignment~
@21555 = ~minstrel~
@215550 = ~Minstrel~
@21556 = ~MINSTREL:
  Of all the many different Bard specialities, the Minstrel is surely the most respected. They are most commonly found in castles and the halls of great lords, entertaining the rich and powerful with their songs. As a result, the song of the Minstrel is often used to charm any drunken creatures who take an unhealthy interest in the Minstrel, though it does not have any of the specific combat abilities of the normal bard song. Minstrels rely on their wit and charisma to survive most situations, making them far more intelligent and even more charismatic than most, including fellow Bards.
  However, the characteristically florid red and purple outfit and silver tongue of the Minstrel should not disguise the fact that he is still a rogue, born and bred. In fact, the charming and colourful exterior conceals a highly devious and cunning mind which excels in using other peoples' high regard of them to his own advantage, although Minstrels are not inherently evil or greedy characters. As a result, the Minstrel is highly skilled in pickpocketing and his wide experience of the world has imbued him with a wide knowledge of magical items and lore.
  The Minstrel is no real fighter, relying on his charming nature and beguiling tongue to outwit or humiliate any would-be opponents. The Minstrel is weaker in strength than other bards, and cannot use any two-handed weapons, as this would adversely affect his appearance (something that is, of course, a source of great pride to the Minstrel). Moreover, he refuses as a matter of personal pride to wear any other clothes apart from red and purple, and although he is a rogue, he is essentially a benevolent one, and so must be of a Good alignment. The Minstrel must, of course, be highly charismatic as well as slim and agile. An overweight Minstrel would be mocked, and no doubt labeled a buffoon.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +4 to maximum Charisma
-  Has +30% bonus to Pick Pocket skill
-  Can use an innate ability to charm people. If the target fails a Saving Throw vs Spells, it is charmed for 60 seconds.

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Does not use 2-handed weapons with any skill
-  Must be of Good alignment
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Requires 16 Strength and 17 Charisma~
@21557 = ~Minstrel Charm~
@21558 = ~troubadour~
@215580 = ~Troubadour~
@21559 = ~TROUBADOUR:
  The Troubadour is a bard who has concentated his efforts on mastering a one-handed weapon of his choice, and as a result, is formidable when wielding this type of weapon. Moreover, not only is the Troubadour an expert in his one-handed weapon, but he is also an expert at dual-wielding. The Troubadour has also developed a special bard song which increases his allies' aggressiveness and raises their number of attacks per round. However, the Troubadour has several key drawbacks, the main one being the fact that concentrating on weaponskill has kept his pickpocket skill from being fully developed, and as such, is severely restricted. Another drawback of this is that although the Troubadour can use other weapons, he has absolutely no training at all with ranged weapons, and thus cannot use them with any skill.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can gain 3 proficiency slots with any one-handed weapon
-  Can have 2 proficiency slots in Two Weapon Style
-  Has a bard song called "Scarlet Rush" (This song causes a slight blood rush in allies and cause them to gain 1 extra attack per round; the effectiveness of the song increases at higher levels)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has no skill with ranged weapons
-  Has only 1/4 Pick Pocket skill
-  Cannot be of Lawful or Evil alignment~
@21560 = ~buccaneer~
@215600 = ~Buccaneer~
@21561 = ~BUCCANEER:
  Throughout the realms, Buccaneers are also known as 'battle bards'. Exceeding all their roguish brethren in sword skills and combat techniques, the prowess of a buccaneer in battle is unrivalled among bards. Their easy-going nature and charismatic attitude naturally predisposes them to a Good alignment. Similarly they are much loved by the general public and their ready storehouse of bawdy tales and humorous anecdotes makes them a welcome addition to any party. However, this superficial appearence should not lead to underestimation of the Buccaneer; they are still deadly warriors. Skilled with ranged weapons, especially the short bow, buccaneers are also able to inflict injuries upon their foes from afar.
  However, due to the heavy weapons training required to become a true Buccaneer, they lack a specialized bard song. Likewise, their thieving skills suffer through lack of practice and preparation. Nevertheless, the Buccaneer's skill in battle and his ready wit render him a valuable member to any group of hearty adventurers.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can have 2 proficiency slots devoted to a short bow
-  Can have 3 proficiency slots devoted to long or short sword
-  Gains +1 AC at levels 1 and 4

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be of Good alignment
-  Has no speciality bard song
-  Does not use 2-handed or blunt weapons with any skill
-  Has only 1/4 of normal pickpocketing skills~
@21562 = ~musician~
@215620 = ~Musician~
@21563 = ~MUSICIAN:
  The Musician's skill with musical instruments is absolutely unrivalled by any within the Realms. His ability to manipulate others with his exceptional skills is nothing short of magical. He is able to use the power of his voice and his harp to channel the subtle emotional currents that underlie the behaviour of all living things. As he becomes more proficient, he gains phenomenal abilities which allow him not only to aid his party, but also to inflict grievous harm upon his foes. The countless hours of practice which are needed to maintain his musical skills inevitably force him to neglect his weapons training. As a result, whilst he is competent enough with a sword, he much rather prefers to use his music to affect the outcome of a battle. The musician never uses any sort of bows for fear that these crude weapons will damage his delicate playing hands.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can be of any alignment
-  Has the bard song of "Rholanda's Blessing" (This grants +2 to all saving throws and +1 luck while the song is played, improving at higher levels)
-  Can hit Deaf Tone at levels 1, 12 and 16 (All enemies in a 30 ft radius must save vs breath at -1 or be deafened for 8 rounds)
-  Can hit Disruption Tone at level 12 (All enemies in a 30 ft radius must save vs breath at -1 or become feeble, 30 ft radius)
-  Can hit Charm Tone at levels 1, 12 and 16 (All enemies in a 30 ft radius must save vs breath at -1 or be charmed for 8 rounds, 30 ft radius)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has only 1/2 pick pocket skills
-  Has only 1/2 of normal bard lore
-  Is only effective with the sling as a ranged weapon~
@21564 = ~Deaf Tone~
@21565 = ~Disruption Tone~
@21566 = ~Charm Tone~
@21567 = ~shaman~
@215670 = ~Shaman~
@21568 = ~SHAMAN:
  The Shaman is a druid who, through many years of patient study and exploration, has established a mystical connection with the land and the spiritual power of the worlds beyond. He is able to call upon the spirits of the land and the powers of ghosts to aid him in combat. The shaman's spiritual connection with nature and its elements allows him to conjure elementals in times of need. The most experienced shamans are able to call upon the ghosts of former druids (which have been reincarnated as shadows) to defend the natural balance of the universe. However, despite his innate abilities, the shaman is not inherently a magic user. His strength has been sapped by years of spiritual meditation and rigorous initiation rituals. The shaman does not wear any armour as it disturbs the natural rhythm of the intricate dances which are involved in the summoning rituals.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains the ability to conjure Fire and Air Elementals at levels 12 and 16
-  Gains the innate ability Cure Light Wounds at levels 1, 5, and 10
-  Has permanent 25% magic and fire resistance, which increase to 50% at level 17
-  Gains the ability to Create Shadows twice per day at level 21

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour
-  Does not use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Receives -5 to maximum Strength
-  Requires 17 Wisdom and 16 Charisma~
@21569 = ~Conjure Air Elemental~
@21570 = ~shadow master~
@215700 = ~Shadow Master~
@21571 = ~SHADOW MASTER:
  Weaving an intricate dance of light and shadow, the Shadow Master is the most mysterious and reclusive of druids. Serving the needs of nature and neutrality within the shadows of the woods, the Shadow Master gains fearsome and enigmatic abilities as he becomes more experienced. He possesses innate abilities which allow him to manipulate and conjure shadows to defend himself or protect the natural balance. The Shadow Master is able to call upon the shadows of the wood to aid him in combat, and, upon reaching the rank of High Druid, can conjure the formidable Greater Shadow. Similarly, the Shadow Master is able to envelop himself in a cloak of darkness which acts effectively as a suit of armour, deflecting and absorbing blows from even the most daunting enemies. The Shadow Master's mysterious powers also enable him to escape from dangerous situations by conjuring a shadow portal.
  However, the Shadow Master's unique skills come at a cost. Unlike most Druids, he is unable to shapeshift, and only the most hardy and agile of humans and half-elves may aspire to this most secretive, enigmatic class.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can be of any Neutral alignment
-  Can Summon a Greater Shadow at levels 12, 15, and 19
-  Can Create Shadows 5 times a day
-  Can cast Shadow Door at levels 1, 10, 14, and 18
-  Can cast Shadow Armour once per day

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Does not shapeshift
-  Requires 17 Dexterity and Constitution~
@21572 = ~Summon Shadow~
@21573 = ~Shadow Armor~
@21574 = ~Armor~
@21575 = ~aerial druid~
@215750 = ~Aerial Druid~
@21576 = ~AERIAL DRUID:
  Aerial Druids were, in the past, capable of flight. Such a gift gave them abilities to see places and tread ground that very few races will ever be able to. Traveling in such hosile places and at heights where the weather can be extremely hazardous, they have acquired limited resistance to electricity, as they are frequently the victims of lightning strikes. Aerial Druids have retained much of the power they wielded when they were capable of flight, and are still unable to wear armour, which they find too restrictive in comparison with the freedom of the skies.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has +3 to Save Throws vs Breath Weapons
-  Has +3 to Save Throws vs Spells
-  Has 25% resistance to electricity
-  Can shapechange in to a powerful Air Elemental at levels 10 and 14
-  Has an improved natural movement rate

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour
-  Can only use the following weapons with any skill: Sling, Staff, Club, Dagger, and Spear.~
@21577 = ~Elemental Morph~
@21578 = ~aquatic druid~
@215780 = ~Aquatic Druid~
@21579 = ~AQUATIC DRUID:
  As the title suggests, the Aquatic Druid is a druid that has spent much of her time underwater, where she makes her home. Aquatic Druids are highly unusual creatures, though their dedication to the defence and preservation of their home is unmatched amongst intelligent beings. Often aquatic druids have parentage one-half sea nymph or merman, and the other half a human fisherman or fishwife, and a life spent in their watery domains have given them many special innate abilities both for defence and offence. For example, an Aquatic Druid possesses a substantial cold resistance, and has several water-based spells, such as Water Shield and Stunning Spray at her disposal. They also have special gills on their bodies, which, apart from looking strange and giving them the ability to breathe water, also expel any offensive gases, so they are completely immune to any cloud or gaseous attacks.
  However, the Aquatic Druid's strange appearance penalizes the reaction they gain from others, and they cannot use any ranged weapons due to the uselessness of such weapons in the water. They also cannot wear any armour at all as this would suffocate their highly sensitive skin. All fire-based attacks will deal increased damage to the Aquatic Druid. The Aquatic Druid also does not have any other shapeshifting abilities apart from the Great White Shark, and like the other highly specialized druids, she cannot cast any of the normal druid spells. Even in the watery domain of the Aquatic Druid, the balance that nature dictates holds true, and the Aquatic Druid must be of a Neutral Alignment as a result.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has 25% resistance to cold
-  Can shapechange into a Sea Guard at levels 10 and 14
-  Is not affected by the majority of vaporous gases

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Does not use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Wears no armour~
@21580 = ~Water Guard~
@21581 = ~justifier~
@215810 = ~Justifier~
@21582 = ~JUSTIFIER:
  The Justifiers are the most feared druids throughout the realms. Dedicating themselves to the protection of nature through armed combat, their extensive weapons training renders them a terrifying force in battle. Whilst most druids shun open combat, the justifiers believe that, ultimately, the natural balance justifies their violent conduct, hence their titles. Their fearsome skills in melee combat bestow upon them a Dexterity bonus, but due to the poor sustenance and harsh surroundings which they endure in their forest homes, their strength and constitution is considerably sapped. The Justifiers rely heavily on their shape-shifting abilities to aid them in battle; they possess many forms ranging from wild bears to werewolves.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +2 to maximum Dexterity
-  Can have 3 proficiency slots devoted to the sling
-  Has a large array of shapeshifting abilities, ranging from bears to werewolves
-  Can be of any Neutral alignment

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Receives -2 to maximum Constitution
-  Must be a Half-Elf~
@21583 = ~dream walker~
@215830 = ~Dream Walker~
@21584 = ~DREAM WALKER:
  Harnessing the power of light and illusion, the Dreamwalker twines together the threads of fantasy and reality, creating an intricate tapestry of phantom images through which he may dominate and destroy the minds of his foes. A master of the illusionary magic, the Dreamwalker is able to harness the power of illusion in order to maintain the grater balance, whilst deceiving and confusing his enemies.
  An added bonus of his immense knowledge of the illusionary and mind bending magic he possesses is the fact that the Dreamwalker is completely immune to all mind control spells, much like the Cerebral Knight. He is also more charismatic than most Druids, though his skills with the twisted images of light and shadow come at a high price. Unlike other druids, the Dreamwalker cannot shapeshift at all, and his strength has been seriously impaired by the immense concentration required to create the phantoms with which he battles the enemies of nature.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +1 to maximum Charisma
-  Gains Visions of Pain at level 14
-  Gains Domination at level 1, 12, and 16
-  Gains Feeblemind at level 12 and 16
-  Is immune to malignant mind-effecting spells

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Unable to shapeshift
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength~
@21585 = ~anti-paladin~
@215850 = ~Anti-Paladin~
@21586 = ~ANTI-PALADIN:
  The Anti-Paladin is the lowest of the low, a true abomination to all that is good and holy in the world. They are utterly selfish, completely self-absorbed, and have no consideration for others. As the complete opposite of everything that is noble about a Paladin, the Anti-Paladins are the truest servants of evil, though their fall into depravity has granted them many unique abilities. They have twisted powers that cause painful diseases combined with a uncanny ability to control undead and all but the most powerful of demons. Moreover, they are immune to all kinds of curses and diseases and can cast many destructive priest spells upon their foes.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives a +2 bonus to all Saving Throws
-  Is immune to all diseases and curses
-  Gains Cause Critical Wounds at levels 1, 12, and 18
-  Gains Dolorous Decay at levels 1, 12 and 21
-  Can control undead and demons at levels 12, 15, and 18
-  Gains low-level offensive magical spells starting at level 9
-  Can use Withering Touch once per day (the opposite of Lay on Hands; it removes 2 hit points per level of experience to the target, with no Saving Throw)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Does not gain the true benefits of being an Anti-Paladin until level 8. If he breaks the laws of Paladinhood before this, he will face the same penalties as a Fallen Paladin.
-  Is only skilled with swords
-  Has no skill in Sword and Shield fighting style
-  Cannot use ranged weapons
-  Has a maximum Charisma of 3
-  Requires 16 Strength, 15 Wisdom and 14 Intelligence~
@21587 = ~Cause Critical Wounds~

@21601 = ~Dark Justice~
@21602 = ~This immense blade has to power to age a target that is struck by the evil blade. If this happens they will lose 10 hit points from their max and loose 1 strength for one day. Such a blade is granted to an anti paladin as he has his beliefs and a god to worship, he is as loyal to his god as others are to their, the blade is a gift for his work.

STATISTICS:

Damage: 1D10+3
THAC0 bonus: +3
Special : ages target
Damage Type:  slashing
Weight: 15
Speed Factor: 10
Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword
Type:  2-handed

Usable By:
 Anti-Paladin~
@21603 = ~cerebral knight~
@216030 = ~Cerebral Knight~
@21604 = ~CEREBRAL KNIGHT:
  One of the most highly specialized of all Paladins, the Cerebral Knight has, since his youth, trained his mind to such a high level that he is able to resist all mental and psionic assaults on him. Moreover, his training has allowed him to use his incredible mental powers to harm others, though he would never turn his powers against his allies. The Cerebral Knight is often tasked with purging Mind Flayer lairs, though his resistances have been known to help combat various spellcasters.
  This exclusive concentration on the powers of the mind, impressive as it is, comes at a cost for the Cerebral Knight. Unlike most Paladins, he possesses no Lay on Hands ability and his lack of training in combat with weapons has left him lacking in melee prowess. Nevertheless, the Cerebral Knight's combination of physical and psionic strengths is a force to be reckoned with.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Is immune to nearly all harmful mental attacks
-  Can Detect Illusions 5 times per day
-  Receives a +2 THAC0 bonus at level 17
-  Can cast Feeblemindedness at levels 1-13
-  Can cast Mind Blow at levels 13 and 16 (This spell will cause the victim to crumble from vibrations if they fail a Saving Throw vs. Death)
-  Can cast Chaotic Commands several times per day

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has no Lay on Hands ability
-  Is only skilled with sword-type weapon categories
-  Cannot cast regular priest spells
-  Cannot use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Requires 15 Wisdom, 13 Strength and Constitution, and 12 Intelligence
-  Does not gain innate abilities as a regular Paladin~
@21605 = ~Mind Blow~
@21606 = ~lord~
@216060 = ~Lord~
@21607 = ~LORD:
  One of the most common of Paladins amongst older men in position of power in Faerun, a Lord is a Paladin who is the leader of a paladin stronghold. Lords are highly respected amongst the upper classes of many communities, particularly large human settlements, for their nobility and Charisma. Years of experience have brought him strength and Charisma, as well as significant training in the use of the two-handed sword and the crossbow, though his comparative age and his large size tend to reduce his mobility and a lack of skill with other weapons. Regardless, Lords are extremely effective fighters, even compared to so-called 'pure' warriors.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can obtain Grand Mastery with the 2-handed sword and cross bow
-  Has +1 to max Charisma

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -2 to maximum Dexterity
-  Is not proficient with light, 1-handed weapons
-  Requires 17 Strength~
@21608 = ~dragon slayer~
@216080 = ~Dragon Slayer~
@21609 = ~DRAGON SLAYER:
  The Dragon Slayer is a paladin who has spent his life in the pursuit of one particular quarry: dragons. As such, they have honed their abilities to resist many of the more fearsome attacks of the dragon-kind, as well as possessing an extremely powerful magical weapon that does significant damage to all dragon-kin. The chief abilities of Dragon Slayers are their immunity to fear, their resistance to a dragon's Wing Buffet attack, and their much-famed ability to create dragon-slaying arrows. Many of the most famous heroes in the history of Faerun have been Dragon Slayers, and their mark is left in the many fire-resistant and dragon-slaying items that are scattered across the land.
  However, unlike most other paladins, the Dragon Slayer has no Lay on Hands ability. He is also less skilled than most paladins in the majority of weapons, having honed his skill in those that are most adept at slaying dragons. Their skill in these chosen weapons far surpasses that of other paladins. Few creatures have failed to be amazed at the sight of a Dragon Slayer in close combat with a gigantic dragon, the Dragon Slayer miraculously resisting most attacks before emerging victorious.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Is granted a magical dragon slaying blade at level 14
-  Is immune to fear
-  Can create 5 Arrows of Dragon Slaying once per day
-  Can resist Wing Buffets
-  Can achieve Grand Mastery with 2-handed weapons

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Requires 17 Strength
-  Requires 15 Constitution
-  Is only skilled with 2-handed weapons in melee
-  Has no Lay on Hands ability~
@21610 = ~Slayer Arrows~
@21611 = ~Arrows of Dragon Slaying~
@21612 = ~These arrows again have dweomers placed on them strictly made for the need of dragon slaying. They are not enchanted vs normal foe but have +3 damage and to hit vs the hide of the wyrm and can aid in getting early damage in of the evil beasts.

@21615 = ~demon slayer~
@216150 = ~Demon Slayer~
@21616 = ~DEMON SLAYER:
  The Demon Slayer is perhaps the most dedicated of all paladins. Haunted by the spectre of demonic evil throughout his life, he is driven by an all-abiding hatred and loathing of these spawns of evil. Clad in a tunic of blinding white, emblazoned with a crimson cross, the Demon Slayer travels the realms, and his coming is like the advent of the angel of death. Wielding a sword of holy fire, he seeks to abolish all remnants of evil throughout the land. Trained especially for combat against demonic creatures, he strikes with great vengeance and furious anger driving the hordes of hell before him. His unshakable faith bestows upon him protection from demon fear. This wondrous immunity coupled with his extensive weapons training (which allows him to achieve mastery in all weapons) renders the Demon Slayer an unstoppable force of goodness and light.
  The Demon Slayer's dedication, however, leads to little time for socializing, and as a result, he incurs a penalty to Charisma. In addition, due to the questionable effectiveness of ranged weapons against creatures of demonic nature, the Demon Slayer avoids these in combat.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has a +3 to hit and damage vs all demonic creatures
-  Is immune to Demon Fear
-  Can devote 3 slots to all available weapons
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has no Lay on Hands ability
-  Cannot use ranged weapons
-  Receives -1 to maximum Charisma
-  Only receives +1 to saves, unlike +2 as other Paladins do~
@21617 = ~saurial paladin~
@216170 = ~Saurial Paladin~
@21618 = ~SAURIAL PALADIN:
  The Saurial Paladin is the weapons expert of the holy order. Such warriors are often found forming the brunt of the fighting force of a holy army. He has forgone any mental training, preferring instead to use weapons in combat; due to this, he lacks the Lay on Hands ability and has no Protection From Evil. To compensate for this, the Saurial Paladin is unrivalled in his expertise in dual-wielding 1-handed weapons. He is always of a Lawful Good alignment and serves the order to the end.

Advantages:
- Can have 3 slots devoted to 1-handed weapons
- Can have 4 slots devoted to dual-wielding

Disadvantages:
- Has no Lay on Hands ability
- Has no Protection From Evil
- Can devote only 1 slot to all ranged weapons~
@21619 = ~dark knight~
@216190 = ~Dark Knight~
@21620 = ~DARK KNIGHT:
  A Dark Knight lacks the significant dedication and motivation of a regular paladin. They are not bound to be of Good alignment, but are not necessarily entirely evil either (a misinterpretation often resulting from the title bestowed upon them). They have some small dedication to priesthood, and as a result, are able to harness a few, minor spells from this sphere. Their clerical ways have also led them to their choice of blunt melee weapons in combat; they can still use blades, but a lack of training means that they do not do so with any skill. In addition, because they lack the motivation of goodness of a normal paladin, they gain no enchantments to protect themselves from the forces of evil.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has access to several minor cleric spells, including Prayer, Bane, Entropic Field, and Call Upon Faith
-  Has no Charisma requirement

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Is only effective with blunt melee weapons
-  Can only be Lawful Evil or Neutral Evil
-  Does not gain Protection from Evil innate ability
-  Requires 13 Strength and 12 Wisdom~
@21621 = ~You and your party have gained a Cloak of Bravery~

@21623 = ~HEALER:
  The Healer is a cleric who specializes in caring for and healing people. Healers are one of the most common of the priest niches due to the fact that they are not only immune to every sort of physical ailment, be it from poison, disease, even magically-based diseases, but also due to their god-like skill in healing. Moreover, Healers can cast all normal priest spells, and the gods themselves have blessed them with an exceptional bonus to constitution and wisdom, allowing them to stand longer in battle whilst healing others. They also gain many extra 'bonus' priest spells. Healers make invaluable additions to any adventuring party.
  On the other hand, however, the Healer's concentration on healing has left him with little in the way of fighting skills, and although he can use the same weapons as other priests, he cannot gain more than proficient status with them. Also, because of minimum physical training during his formative years, the strength and dexterity of a Healer suffer, though his god-given high constitution does something to compensate for this. Healers must also naturally be of lawful good alignment.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains Cure Poison and Cure Disease at levels 10, 13, and 16
-  Gains Cure Serious Wounds at levels 13 and 16
-  Gains Heal at levels 15 and 18

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be of Lawful Good alignment
-  Gains no fighting style bonuses
-  Receives -3 to maximum Strength and Dexterity
-  Requires 17 Wisdom and 16 Constitution
-  Must be a Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc or Dwarf~

@216240 = ~Priest of Selune~
@21625 = ~PRIEST OF SELUNE:
  The priests of the Lady of Silver (as Selune is known) are a powerful force for goodness in the Forgotten Realms. However, their chaotic nature makes them somewhat unpredictable and wilful. The patronage of Selune bestows upon her clerics a upon her Clerics a resistance to malicious spells cast their way. A mystical bond that exists between Selune and her chosen allows the clerics to create a faint nimbus of moonlight around them which permits them to see in the dark. This ability is analogous to infravision which is an innate capacity of the non-human races in Faerun. The clerics' devotion to their goddess allows them to cast a number of low level spells. However, their spell selection is largely restricted by their alignment, and the majority of these are of a healing or supporting nature. The clerics are able to wear armour and use a shield to protect themselves from enemies, but are restricted to the same weapon types as the majority of magic-users in Faerun.

-  Gains Moon Fire at levels 1, 12, and 16  (does 2D4 +2 damage per level of the caster up to a max of 2D+20)
-  Can create a Moon Blade at level 14 that will last for 1 round per experience level. As the blade is made of moonlight, they may wield it without breaking the laws of priesthood. The blade grants a +3 bonus to THAC0 and inflicts 1D12+4 damage against undead.

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Must be of Chaotic Good alignment

@21637 = ~PRIEST OF MALAR:
  Malar, also known as the Stalker or the Beastlord, is a chaotic evil deity who makes his home in the plane of Tartarus, but often roams the Prime Material Plane, possessing the bodies of his devout in berserker frenzy. Malar is the god of marauding beasts, of the savage wild, of bloodlust, and the hunt.  With Umberlee and Auril, he is one of the Gods of Fury who serve Talos.  Weakened with the growing strength of Talos, he has found new worshippers among the non-human tribes.  His symbol is a taloned, bestial claw.
  Priests of Malar will seek out and attempt to destroy druids, regardless of the faith that the druid professes.  Because druids fight to maintain a balance, they are the antithesis of the single-minded Malarites. Druid organizations, including the Harpers and followers of Mielikki, also try to seek out and destroy Malar strongholds.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains a number of offensive mage spells

@21648 = ~PRIEST OF AURIL:
  The Priests of Auril are followers of the Goddess of Cold Fury. They are loyal to their goddess in a very fierce manner, and any suggestion of insult to their deity will instantly spark rage in their hearts. They are usually of Neutral Evil alignment. A Priest of Auril gains several offensive and defensive abilities based on the manipulation of ice and cold.

@21652 = ~warlock~
@216520 = ~Warlock~
@21653 = ~WARLOCK:
  The Warlock is a priest who has turned his spiritual power to evil and selfish use. Through years of study and concentration, he has learned to use necromancy and conjuration spells in order to destroy those foolish enough to stand in his way, as well as to protect himself from those who would benefit from his demise. His study of dark magics has allowed him to gain control over the demonic underworld and, at high levels, a Warlock can summon a Tanar'ri demon to do his bidding. Ultimately, when a Warlock reaches these dizzying heights of power, he becomes totally immune to all necromantic spells.
  However, due to his constant magical study, the Warlock's physical attributes suffer, his constitution and stamina heavily penalized. Only the most evil of clerics have the potential to become a Warlock.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains innate necromancy and conjuration spells at levels 9 through 16
-  At level 18, can summon a Tanar'ri demon for 1 turn

@216590 = ~Protector of the Faith~
@21660 = ~PROTECTOR OF THE FAITH:
  A Protector of the Faith is a battle priest that is the front line of the holy guard. Protectors of the Faith are entirely dedicated to the god to whom they have pledged their devotion, and have sworn to defend the name of their deity at all costs. They have much better fighting skills than regular clerics, but have poor Wisdom as they spend most of their time perfecting their weapon skills. This has the result that while their combat skills are vastly superior to other priests, their spellcasting skills have suffered greatly. Overall, however, a fighter such as this is an asses to any group or organisation.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can devote 3 slots to the Flail, Mace, and Warhammer
-  Gains +2 THAC0 bonus at level 14

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -5 to maximum Wisdom
-  Can only be of a Good alignment
-  Cannot be a Human, Elf or Half-Elf~

@216610 = ~Drow Priest~
@21662 = ~DROW PRIEST:
  The life of all Drow revolves around the worship of their fearsome spider goddess, Lolth. As such, the Drow Priest is a figure of fear and respect in all cities of the Underdark. The Drow warlike nature is reflected in the priest's skill with the flail and morningstar. However, despite his military skill, the priest's strength has been sapped through neglect of physical training. Instead, the priest devotes himself to the worship of Lolth, an occupation through which the he strives to become the chosen of the dark deity. Like all Drow, the priest has an inherent resistance to magic, and can also afflict his enemies with Visions of Pain with the aid of Lolth.

@21663 = ~priest of Silvanus~
@216630 = ~Priest of Silvanus~
@21664 = ~PRIEST OF SILVANUS:
  Silvanus is the most powerful of the wild nature gods of the Realms, and is of equal power to Chauntea, who represents a more ordered nature. The two are on good terms, as are most of the good and neutral nature deities. Silvanus is served by Mielikki, and many of the followers of one deity venerate the other as well.  Silvanus takes pride in his true neutrality, and can be found on the plane of Concordant Opposition, the plane of neutrality. Nature and its perfect balance is the dogma of Silvanus, who measures out both flood and drought, fire and ice, life and death, in the wilderness. As such, Priests of Silvanus have an affinity with nature, and their power is largely based upon the manipulation of it.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains Fire Ward at levels 10 and 12 (This grants the party complete immunity to fire damage for 1 round per 2 levels of the priest)

@21671 = ~priest of Tybboch~
@216710 = ~Priest of Tybboch~
@21672 = ~PRIEST OF TYBBOCH:
  Priests of Tybboch are often malicious and mostly insane men who have had their minds tainted by the corrupt touch of their god. When they make the decision to serve the god of disease, Tybboch, they are bound to this choice, and cannot change classes thereafter. Any attempt to Dual Class would result in a slow, steady death caused by a disease sent by Tyboch himself. Priest of Tybboch tend to prefer small towns with small populations. In particular, they look for towns or villages that have been touched by disease and death. A Priest of Tybboch feels that it is his job to finish the chaos that his god has begun. Followers of Tybboch are universally male, but there have been reported exceptions. They set up their temples or churches in broken old buildings and squats to reduce the attention from outsiders. The priests themselves mainly ignore each other unless they face a powerful enemy. More often than not they will plot against each other to gain favour with their god.

ADVANTAGES:

@21673 = ~Dominate Undead~
@21674 = ~priest of Tempus~
@216740 = ~Priest of Tempus~
@21675 = ~PRIEST OF TEMPUS:
  The Battle Guards of Tempus are a warrior race of priests that have dedicated themselves to intense physical and mental training. Their spell casting ability is equal to that of any regular priest, even gaining some additional abilities. They are often seen wielding a holy weapon: a flail which they create with their own power. Such a weapon has a mental link with the user and, when summoned, draws some of its power from the user. The more experienced the caster is, the more power that the flail will contain. Battle Guards of Tempus are greatly feared and respected in battle for their subtantial melee ability; however, they are not capable of using ranged weapons, and their agressive combat approach comes at the cost of their Dexterity.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can create a Hero's Feast once per day
-  Gains Blade Curse at level 8, 10 and 12 (This curses the blades of nearby foe, causing it to lose 1 point from its enchantment)

@21680 = ~priest of Amaunator~
@216800 = ~Priest of Amaunator~
@21681 = ~PRIEST OF AMAUNATOR:
  The Priests of Amaunator are believers and worshippers of the great god of the sun, Amaunator. They are universally known to be of a good alignment and nature. Some people have found that they are not always this way, but these cases are extremely rare. In exchange for their worship, they gain many benefits from the god of the sun; mostly based upon the power of the sun itself. The benefits range from offensive or defensive aids to even allowing the priest to replicate the material form of Amaunator. Such powerful aid from a god in exchange for worship certainly explains why some chose such a deity in which to worship.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can cast Amaunator's Uncertainty 2 times per day (Makes all creatures in the current area lose quickness of judgement and stuns them for three rounds)
-  Can create a Sun Sceptre at levels 12 and 16 for 1 turn (This spell creates a weapon of sun fire that causes 1D12+3 damage and 1D4 fire damage, and has a 15% chance of dominating the target for 2 turns; if they are dominated, they are fully healed)

@21686 = ~priest of Shar~
@216860 = ~Priest of Shar~
@21687 = ~PRIEST OF SHAR:
  Shar is the goddess of darkness, night, loss, and forgetfulness.  She resides in the extradimensional plane of Hades. Shar is an unusual power in that she seems to have multiple aspects that have different alignments; the most obvious example is Sharess, who gained enough of a following to break away from Shar and become a separate entity. An aspect of Shar that deals with forgetfulness has a following of priests intent on maintaining their neutrality. Shar's main aspect, on the other hand, is worshipped by those who deal in the night (such as thieves), who hate the light (such as goblin races and their allies), and who feel bitterness and loss. Her symbol is a black disk with a border of deep purple.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can Cast Armour of Darkness once per day (This will last for 1 round/level of the caster, and for every 4 levels of exp it will grant a +1 bonus to AC up to a max of +4)
-  Can summon creatures of darkness at levels 14 and 16 (Summons 1 or 2 creatures capable of draining ability scores for 8 rounds)

@21690 = ~Dark Bolt~
@21691 = ~priest of Tyr~
@216910 = ~Priest of Tyr~
@21692 = ~PRIEST OF TYR:
  Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Even-Handed, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, and Blind Tyr. All of these names represent the Realms' god of justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing his right hand, lost in proving his resilience and strength of spirit. In recent years, he has been shown blinded as well, a fatality of the Time of Troubles and the Avatars.  He is the only greater power to be of Lawful Good alignment, and is said to make his home in the lower slopes of the great mountain that is the Seven Heavens.  Tyr's symbol is the scales resting upon a warhammer, and shows his nature: Justice through the strength to enforce that justice. Tyr is served by the lesser god Torm.
  Tyr and his followers are devoted to the cause of justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of vengeance. This is not necessarily equality or fairness, as some make the maimed god out to represent, but rather the discovery of truth and the punishment of the guilty. Tyr's followers tend to be stiff-necked about theology, and see matters in black and white terms. He is most popular with bureaucrats, judges, and merchants who make the entire system move efficiently.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can devote 2 slots to the warhammer
-  Has a +1 bonus to damage with the warhammer
-  Can cast Boon of the God at level 12 (This fully restores the priest to normal and 100% health; it also grants him +10 hit points to his max, but blinds him and lowers his THAC0 by 1 for 2 turns)

@216950 = ~Priest of Mystra~
@21696 = ~PRIEST OF MYSTRA:
  Mystra is the goddess of magic, which makes her one of the most powerful deities in the Realms. Known also as the Lady of Mysteries, she is said to have taught the first spellcaster of the Realms, and to have enabled many of the races to use magic.
  During the Time of Troubles, Mystra was destroyed and replaced by a mortal named Midnight who took the mantle of goddesshood and the goddess's portfolio. At this time, Mystra's stated alignment shifted from Lawful Neutral, maintaining the balance in use of magic, to Neutral Good, reflecting the mortal's attitudes towards the uses and purpose of magic. In the field, all priests of Mystra wear armour, and bear the symbol of Mystra on their shields as a display of their faith.  They can use all bludgeoning weapons and the same magical items allowed by both clerics and wizards, except wizard scrolls.

@21698 = ~wilderness protector~
@216980 = ~Wilderness Protector~
@21699 = ~WILDERNESS PROTECTOR:
  The Wilderness Protector is a Ranger who spends almost all of his time alone in woodland areas. In doing so, the Wilderness Protector has learned to bond with animals. In addition to calling animals as allies, he can also summon darker beings as he gains experience. Due to the amounts of time he spends in woodland areas, heavier armour causes great problems for the Wilderness Protector, and as a result, he will never wear anything heavier than Studded Leather armour. Since the Wilderness Protector is not often involved in combat, he will only wield weapons which he uses in everyday survival in the forest. These solitary Rangers do not spend a great deal of time socializing with other people, and as a result of this, they are not known for being particularly charismatic.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can call on any animal in sight to aid him (with no Saving Throw) at levels 1 and 12
-  Gains Monster Summoning IV at level 13, Monster Summoning V at level 16, and Monster Summoning VI at level 19

-  Cannot have more than 1 proficiency slot devoted to any melee weapon~
@21700 = ~Call Allies~
@21701 = ~samurai~
@217010 = ~Samurai~
@21702 = ~SAMURAI:
  An ideal Samurai is a stoic warrior who follows an unwritten code of conduct known as the Bushido which holds bravery, honour and personal loyalty above life itself. A true Samurai is a grand master of the katana and wakizashi. His mastery of these blades is unparalleled, and the deadly precision with which he wields them strikes fear in the heart of even the most determined foe. The samurai invariably bears both his blades in combat and the amount of strict training and meditation needed to achieve this sort of skill grants him exceptional bonuses to his dexterity. His total dedication to the katana and wakizashi means that the samurai is unable to wield ranged weapons. However, his lightning-fast reflexes and super-human agility have granted him the ability to deflect missiles.
  The Samurai's total commitment to his chosen weaponry prevents him from specializing in any other weapons than the katana and wakizashi. His Wisdom and constitution are penalized due to the restrictive training dictated by the Bushido. The Samurai does not wear any armour greater than studded leather as it impedes his agility and hence his ability to fight with both blades. Ultimately, only the most agile and dexterous of humans possess the necessary physical attributes to become a true Samurai.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Have a +4 AC vs. missiles
-  Can use the Kuatoray Technique at levels 8, 12, and 15 for 6 rounds (This technique allows them to wield their weapon with an extremely light-handed grip. When they swing their weapon, the grip is so loose that the blade will practically fly out of their hands at the opponent. This technique increases the number of attacks per round to the maximum due to the slinging style. There is a +2 bonus to accuracy, but 4 less damage is done with every hit since the samurai does not hit with full force)
-  Can have 5 proficiency slots devoted to katanas and scimitars
-  Receives +2 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has weapon skills only with katanas and scimitars
-  Receives -1 to maximum Wisdom and Constitution
-  Wears no armour greater than studded leather
-  Uses no ranged weapon with any skill
-  Casts no druidic spells, does not charm animals
-  Requires 17 Dexterity

@217040 = ~Shadow Elf~
@21705 = ~SHADOW ELF:
  The Shadow Elf is an elven ranger that has spent a large amount if of his time learning to cast spells from tomes of arcane. Shadow Elves are greatly respected amongst the elven community for their intelligence and skill, and greatly feared amongst the servants of evil for their power and stealth. With the ability to cast spells from memory, the Shadow Elf limits himself to studded leather armour as anything greater would hinder his casting. In addition, the Shadow Elf does not use ranged weapons effectively due to lack of practice, but they are capable of making excellent use of darkness and shadow to hide from their foes.

ADVANTAGES:
-  They gain the following innate spells:
        level 10 - Dispel Magic, Cure Disease
        level 12 - x2 Cure Light Wounds
        level 14 - x2 Fireball
        level 16 - Protection From the Elements

@21710 = ~DROW RANGER:
  The Drow Ranger's most important task is the pursuit and execution of the Drow enemies. All Drow Rangers are expert in the use of swords and excel in the use of these weapons far beyond their distant elven cousins. Like all Drow, the rangers have a natural resistance to magic, which improves with their skill and experience. The rangers possess a number of spells which allow them to execute their duties with the utmost efficiency. These deadly, shadowy hunters prize agility and nimbleness above all other traits. They shun the protection offered by the heavier suits of Drow adamantite armour which inevitably curtails their mobility. Lolth favours her lethal hunters above the other warriors, granting them the ability to scatter their enemies with unholy fire.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains 5% magic resistance per level up to level 10, then 5% every 2 levels up to level 18
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Gains Shadow Door at levels 1 and 12
-  Gains Burning Hands at levels 1 and 12
-  Can cast Know Alignment and Dispel Magic once per day
-  Can have 3 proficiency slots devoted to a sword of any type

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives -8 to maximum Charisma
-  Must be of Evil alignment
-  Must be an Elf
-  Wears no armour greater than studded leather, and cannot wear enchanted elven chainmail due to their banishment from the elven community
-  Suffers a -2 THAC0 and AC penalty in the sunlight
-  As a Drow, is often subject to raids from racial enemies~
@21711 = ~tracker~
@217110 = ~Tracker~
@21712 = ~TRACKER:
  The Tracker is much like the Stalker. He receives bonuses to his stealth skills due to his woodland camouflage. Unlike the Stalker, however, the Tracker does his hunting for himself, not for contracts. He specializes in taking out his target with minimal struggle and prefers to paralyze or disarm the target before the kill. He is an expert in the use of disabling drugs and expelling foreign substances from his body before they can take affect. Because of his reliance on stealth, and his aversion to direct combat, the Tracker will avoid wearing heavy armour. He is also very specific in his choice of weapons, and will rarely choose swords or larger weapons to attack with, as they are not ideal for a quick kill.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has +40% to Hide in Shadows and Move Silently skills
-  Can devote 3 proficiency slots to all ranged weapons
-  Can create 3 stun arrows per day (save vs paralyze)
-  Can have 3 proficiency slots devoted to axe skills
-  Gains Web at levels 1, 12 and 16
-  Can cast Hold Monster and Hold Person once per day
-  Is immune to diseases and poisons

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour greater than studded leather
-  Must be Neutral
-  Does not use swords or two-handed weapons with any skill~
@21713 = ~Web~
@21714 = ~Hold Person~
@21715 = ~Hold Undead~
@21716 = ~Stun Shot~
@21717 = ~This arrow is of the finest craftmanship. Tipped with an extremely potent paralyzing agent, upon contact it can cause the target to freeze. This arrow is considered by many to be the calling card of the Tracker.~
@21718 = ~giant reaper~
@217180 = ~Giant Reaper~
@21719 = ~GIANT REAPER:
  The Giant Reapers are sworn to cleanse Faerun of their mortal enemies, the Giant Kin. As a result of the Giant Reaper's secrecy, it is difficult to fathom the reasons behind their hatred of the Giants. However, it is clear that these grim-faced and aloof men are driven by a desire for wrath and vengeance. They are a bleak and dour breed, but their mastery in battle against the giant kin is unmatched in all of Faerun. After years of combat against the giants, the reapers have developed a curious fighting style of their own. Having learnt the futility of facing these dread creatures with a sword and shield, most giant reapers shun this combination in combat; they have also learned the ineffectivness of ranged weapons in combat, and will rarely choose these. Giant Reapers have very little need of good speed or reflexes, as the opponents they deal with are far slower than them. Their all-pervading hatred of the giant kin and their single-minded dedication to their profession allows these fearless warriors to achieve a state of berserker-like fury, within which they are truly a fearsome sight to behold.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has +5 damage and +4 THACO vs Giant Kin (includes ogres, golems, efreeti, djinni, fire and air elementals)
-  Gains Berserker Rage at levels 1, 12, and 16

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Can have only 1 proficiency slot devoted to ranged weapons
-  Has no skill in sword and shield style
-  Receives -1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Has a very slow casting time, having been trained mostly in melee
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail~
@21720 = ~slayer of the eye~
@217200 = ~Slayer of the Eye~
@21721 = ~SLAYER OF THE EYE:
  The Slayer of the Eye has devoted his time in learning how to slay and resist the effects of the beholder. Their grudge against the elder orbs in not clear but they have poured all their physical resources in to resisting the effect of their ray. They can even slash and reflect the rays back at the beholder which gives a huge advantage over many others that try to face an elder orb in combat. Slayers of the Eye are often hired to clear out infestations of beholders, succeeding against the deadly beasts where many others had failed. However, their ability to resist the attacks of beholders comes at a cost, and they have honed their fighting style to the optimum for destroying the beasts; as a result of this, they do not use ranged weapons, and do not wear heavier forms of armour, preferring quick movement to firm protection when fighting eye tyrants. Slayers of the Eye are not subtle in the methods they use to tackle beholders, and as such, have limited experience in applying stealth to combat.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Is able to reflect rays fired by beholders once per day for 3 turns
-  Is particularly proficient with scimitars and long swords and can devote 4 proficiency slots to either
-  Is immune to the Imprisonment that elders use on their foe

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Does not use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Has a -30% penalty to stealth skill
-  Wears no armour greater than splint mail
-  Must be a Human or Half-Elf~
@21722 = ~Elder Parry~
@21723 = ~elven forest warrior~
@217230 = ~Elven Forest Warrior~
@21724 = ~ELVEN FOREST WARRIOR:
  The Elven Forest Warrior is an ancient sacred race of rangers, charged to defend the elven community in the forests in which the dwell. They are extremely secretive, and little is known of their skills, even amongst their own elven people. They possess the unique and highly secret ability to call animal totem magic to aid them in their journeys. They also choose to limit their armour to studded leather as some of the advantages gained via the totem magic can be restricted by heavy bulky armour. They also shunned the use of swords in the upbringing, and as a result do not wield swords with any skill except for the katana.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has a x2 backstab multiplier
-  Can summon the spirits of animals to aid them via sacred elven totem magic; the totems are as follows:
    Level 10 -- Bear (+2 Strength for 2 turns)
    Level 10 -- Coyote (-1 THAC0, -1 strength, -1 AC to target for 1 turn)
    Level 12 -- Eagle (+1 to missile THAC0 for 1 turn)
    Level 12 -- Fox (+25% stealth skill)
    Level 14 -- Horse (+2 to speed for 6 rounds)
    Level 14 -- Squirrel (+ 2 Dexterity for 1 turn)
    Level 16 -- Tortoise (+2 AC for 1 turn)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour greater than studded leather
-  Uses no swords with any skill except for the katana
-  Rolls 1D8 instead of 1D10 for his initial hit points
-  Must be an Elf or Half-Elf~

@21731 = ~Totem Tortoise~
@21732 = ~slinger~
@217320 = ~Slinger~
@21733 = ~SLINGER:
  The Slingers are antisocial people who band together and survive in groups in woodland areas. Each one is a master with a sling, as it is the weapon that he uses to bring down the animals that he hunts. While they are far from sociable, Slingers are not despised amongst some societies as certain other groups are. Slingers also have a knowledge of chemicals and natural substances, and are able to create certain bullets that can effect a target in many different ways. However, Slingers have little experience with other weapons, particularly other ranged weapons, and their woodland lifestyle dictates that they wear no greater than studded leather armour.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can have 5 proficiency slots devoted to the sling
-  Can create 1 venom, lava, and stunning bullet per day
-  Gains +1 THAC0 and damage with the sling at levels 1, 8, 12, 15, 18 and 21

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Wears no armour greater than studded leather
-  Does not use other ranged weapon with any degree of skill
-  Must be a Human or Half-Elf~
@21734 = ~Create Bullets~
@21735 = ~ninja~
@217350 = ~Ninja~
@21736 = ~NINJA:
  The Ninja is a curious hybrid of the thief and the fighter. Many creatures, however, never live long enough to learn much more of these stealthy fighters. The Ninja is highly agile, gaining a significant bonus to his dexterity as well as his speed. He is highly skilled in evading all kinds of harm. Many a time a Ninja has walked out only slightly singed from a powerful explosion that would have killed creatures many times his strength. His ability of Harm Evasion is one of his best-kept secrets.  Moreover, the Ninja can specialize to the level of Grand Mastery with a blade of his choice, though his preferred weapon is the rare and deadly katana which is especially prized for its use as a backstabbing weapon; a skill in which the Ninja also receives a significant bonus. At the peak of his experience, however, the Ninja is much weaker in strength and constitution than most thieves and fighters, for his speciality is in lurking in the shadows, dealing out a silent death to all who cross him. Other thief skills apart from the backstab ability also suffer as a result of less training during his youth in the "traditional" thieving skills. Additionally, the only ranged weapon that the Ninja may use is the dart, though he can reach a level of Mastery with this weapon to compensate for this.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Receives +2 to maximum Dexterity
-  Able to reach Grand Mastery with a blade-type weapon category of choice
-  Gains Harm Evasion at levels 1, 10, and 14
-  Gains Mirror Image at levels 12 and 18
-  Gains +1 AC bonus at levels 1 and 16
-  THAC0 improves at a rate inbetween a Thief and a Fighter

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Gains only 15 thieving skill points per level
-  Cannot be of Good alignment
-  Receives -2 to maximum Strength
-  Receives -1 to maximum Constitution
-  Cannot use ranged weapons except the dart with any skill
-  Cannot set snares~
@21737 = ~Harm Evasion~
@21738 = ~knife bearer~
@217380 = ~Knife Bearer~
@21739 = ~KNIFE BEARER:
  The Knife Bearer has trained for most of his life in the use of knives and throwing knives, and other small blades, and as a result of this, is able to use these weapons with exceptional skill. The skill required for such deadly use of these weapons requires to Knife Bearer to be unusually quick and dextrous. The accuracy of his attacks, and the damage that the Knife Bearer is able to cause with his weapons, increases as he becomes even more experienced. Unfortunately, the Knife Bearer's dedication to such a specific group of weapons has led to a complete lack of proficiency in the use of other weapons, particularly of the more cumbersome type.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can be of any alignment
-  Receives +1 to hit and damage with his throwing knives at levels 1, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 20
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Can achieve Grand Mastery with knives

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Requires 18 Dexterity
-  Only proficient with knives and short swords
-  Sets no snares
-  Must be a Halfling~
@21740 = ~sniper~
@217400 = ~Sniper~
@21741 = ~SNIPER:
  The Sniper is a thief who has gained extraordinary levels of proficiency with the bow, and is deadly when using such a weapon from a range, unseen by his enemies. Whilst their skill in the art of archery cannot parallel that of a true archer, the sniper's thieving skills render him an invaluable addition to any party. Due to the long hours of training with the bow and arrow, the sniper's melee ability has been neglected. Whilst he is still a deft hand with the dagger, the sniper cannot use any other melee weapon at all. Similarly, his backstabbing skills have suffered and he cannot deal out as much damage as other thieves.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Gains bonus damage and accuracy with the bow, but not to the extent of the archer
-  Can create a Venom Shot once per day (+10 THAC0, rapid poison for 2 rounds if save vs death/poison is failed)
-  Can have 5 proficiency slots devoted to the short bow, short sword, dagger, and crossbow

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has no backstab multiplier
-  Can only be effective with daggers, short swords, crossbows, and bows
-  Sets no snares
-  Must be a Halfling or an Elf~
@21742 = ~svirfneblin~
@217420 = ~Svirfneblin~
@21743 = ~SVIRFNEBLIN:
  These underground Gnomes live side by side with the fearsome dark elves known as Drow. Generations of persecution by the Drow have taught the Svirfneblin potentially life-saving illusion skills which allow them to elude their deadly Drow enemies and confuse their foes. The Svirfneblin have harnessed the power of illusion to its fullest extent, and are known throughout Faerun as masters of deception. Being forced to rely on their hunting skills for many hundreds of years, the Svirfneblin have become masters of the dagger. Many an unsuspecting traveler has fallen pray to these surprisingly vicious and dangerous Gnomes. However, their aversion to the company of other races invariably incurs a penalty to their Charisma, and their thieving skills suffer as a result of a lack of advanced training.

Advantages:
-  Can devote 5 slots to the dagger
-  Gains Mirror Image at levels 1 and 12
-  Gains Mass Invisibility at levels 12 and 16
-  Gains Blur and Blindness once per day
-  Has an AC base of 2
-  Base 20% magic resistance +5% every level after 7 to a max of 70%
-  Receives +1 to maximum Wisdom and Dexterity

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot be of Evil alignment
-  Must be a Gnome
-  Require 15 Dexterity
-  Receives -1 to maximum Charisma
-  Receives -1 to maimum Intelligence
-  Gains only 20 theiving points per level
-  Cannot set traps~
@21744 = ~Mass Invisibility~
@21745 = ~drow assassin~
@217450 = ~Drow Assassin~
@21746 = ~DROW ASSASSIN:
  Agility, dexterity and grace. These words epitomize the deadly skill of the Drow Assassin. Like all Drow, the assassin is absolutely and totally ruthless. His dexterity is unmatched amongst all the races and the very mention of his name will strike fear into the most dauntless hearts. What the assassin lacks in brute strength, he makes up for in stealth and suppleness. As he gains skill and experience the assassin is able to create poison darts, weapons which can bring down even the strongest of foes. The assassin also possesses a degree of magic resistance and a small arsenal of magic spells, abilities which make this dark Elf a silent and terrifying killing machine.
  The Drow Assassian's dependancy on speed and stealth have left little need for sheer brute strength or hardiness, and, as an assassin, his thieving skills are not as advanced as the more common theives.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can create 1 Poisoned Dart and 1 Diseased Dart at levels 1, 12 and 16
-  Has a +1 to hit and damage
-  Gains 5% magic resistance per level up to level 10, then 5% every 2 levels up to level 18
-  Gains Shadow Door innate ability at levels 1 and 12
-  Can use Crippling Strike at levels 8 and 10 (This 2 handed attack to a target's spine will stun the target for 5 rounds if they fail save vs death)
-  Receives +1 to maximum Intelligence

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Receives only 15 thieving points per level
-  Sets no snares
-  Must be of Evil alignment
-  Must be an Elf
-  Receives -10 to maximum Charisma
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength and Constitution
-  Suffers a -2 THAC0 and AC penalty in the sunlight
-  As a Drow, is often subject to raids from racial enemies~

@21748 = ~You have stunned the target with a spinal blow~
@21749 = ~burglar~
@217490 = ~Burglar~
@21750 = ~BURGLAR:
  The Burglar is the undisputed master of robbery and larceny. Expert in the art of lock picking, the Burglar is capable of gaining entry to all but the most heavily guarded compounds. Having honed his skills on the streets since his childhood, theft has become the Burglar's way of life. His skills are constantly in use and as a result his pick pocketing abilities are endowed with great bonuses. The most skilled Burglars can become adept in the art of mugging, being able to send their prospective victim into a deep sleep resembling a coma. However, the Burglar, unlike other thieves, is unable to set traps. Such a skill is redundant in his line of work, and as a result, the Burglar devotes no time to learning this skill.
  Unfortunately, the burglar's stealthy and secretive training has left his physical strength neclected, as a results of a lack of vigorous exercise; this leads to incurrence of a penalty to his strength. Gnomes and Halflings possess the necessary agility and Dexterity to become Burglars, and have the ideal size and build for the required tasks, though Half-elves are also fast and agile enough for the profession.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Has +50 to pick pockets skill
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity
-  Gains Deep Sleep at levels 1, 12 and 16 (This will send the target in to a standing coma if it fails save vs spells at -1)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Sets no snares
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Cannot be of Lawful or Good alignment
-  Must be a Gnome, Halfling or Half-Elf~
@21751 = ~Deep Sleep~
@21752 = ~planewalker thief~
@217520 = ~Planewalker Thief~
@21753 = ~PLANEWALKER THIEF:
  The Planewalker Thief possesses strange and fearsome innate abilities. He is truly a mercenary in terms of his outlook on life, and will stop at nothing in order to complete a contract. Whether he is hired to assassinate a demon lord or to simply steal an artefact of ancient power, the Planewalker faces all challenges in a ruthless, unemotional and cold-blooded manner. At higher levels, the Planewalker is able to call upon allies from the planes of air, fire, and shadow. In times of need, the Planewalker can summon a greater air elemental, a shadow lord, or even the most powerful creature of all, a Tanar'ri demon, to aid him in battle. The Planewalker uses wormholes in the fabric of reality to swiftly travel from one point in the Realms to another.
  However, the Planewalker is unable to become proficient in any sort of ranged weapons. Similarly, his thieving skills and trap setting abilities suffer as a result of the long hours of magical study required to master the skills of outer-planar travel.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can have 2 proficiency slots devoted to the dagger
-  Can have 3 proficiency slots in 2-weapon style
-  Gains Call Outerplane Ally at levels 15 and 21
-  Can cast Shadow Door 3 times per day

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Cannot be Good or Evil
-  Does not use ranged weapons with any skill
-  Gains only 15 thieving skill points per level
-  Requires 12 Charisma
-  Sets no snares
-  Is only skilled with daggers and short swords
-  Must be a Human, Elf, Half-Elf or Halfling~
@21754 = ~Call Outerplane Ally~
@21755 = ~thug~
@217550 = ~Thug~
@21756 = ~THUG:
  The Thug is a nothing more than a violent, ruthless, and sadistic criminal who inhabits the deprived areas of Faerun, awaiting the next victim like an unthinking animal. Relying on brute force and sheer strength to batter his victims senseless, the Thug forms a stark picture in contrast to the graceful assassin. The Thug is aided in the tasks he performs by the fact that he is larger, stronger and possesses much more stamina than the common thief. He also excels in the use of weapons, able to achieve higher levels of skill than his more common brethren, especially with the dagger, since years of stabbing people in the guts has enabled the thug to become a master of this weapon.
  Thugs are invariably of Evil alignment, as this line of work requires an especially twisted and sadistic mind, geared to causing the most amount of damage to another creature, and even taking a depraved pleasure in it.
  However, their crude manners and boorish conduct incurs a serious penalty to their Charisma, since in their line of work, being charming and friendly does not offer much opportunity for progression. They also are unable to set traps, since they lack both the patience and dedication to the task at hand.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can gain 2 proficiency slots with any melee weapons usable by theives
-  Can gain 3 proficiency slots with the dagger
-  Has a bonus 10 HP at level 1

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Can only be of Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil alignments
-  Receives -6 to maximum Charisma
-  Gains only 15 thieving skill points per level
-  Sets no snares~
@21757 = ~huntsman~
@217570 = ~Huntsman~
@21758 = ~HUNTSMAN:
  The Huntsman is an elven thief whose skills were honed in the native forests of the elves, hence allowing him to gain skills beyond those of the average thief. His extensive knowledge of herbal lore and natural medicines allows him to create a number of poisons and ointments which can be used to incapacitate his opponents. Whilst his thieving skills are not equal to the likes of the burglar, he is nevertheless capable of performing all but the most demanding thieving tasks. His elven heritage allows him to specialize in bows, transcending the skills of most thieves with this ranged weapon. The Huntsman is able to entrap his prey using a thick web: a fearsome ability which has proven the downfall of many haughty foes. However, the Huntsman's elusive nature and his tendency to remain aloof from others incurs a penalty to his Charisma. Likewise, due to the emphasis which is placed on dexterity and agility, the Huntsman's strength is sapped through his neglect of rigorous training.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can create 3 stun arrows per day
-  Can have 2 proficiency slots devoted to bows
-  Can cast Web at levels 1 and 12
-  Receives +1 to maximum Dexterity

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Cannot be of Good alignment
-  Gains only 15 thieving skill points per level
-  Receives -3 to maximum Charisma
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Must be an Elf~
@21759 = ~delver~
@217590 = ~Delver~
@21760 = ~DELVER:
  While the Delver is something of a jack-of-all-trades, priding himself on posessing the abilities of a fighter, mage, rogue and cleric, he is primarily a thief. He has greater physical advantages than a regular rogue, is quite capable of gaining significant proficiency in any of the weapons used by thieves. He is extremely well fitted to a new adventuring party as he provides advantages of many other classes. He does however lack the skill of theft and his pick pocketing skills are somewhat worse than that of an average thief. As the saying goes, the Delver is a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can be of any alignment
-  Gains an extra 2 HP per level from levels 10 to 12, and 1 HP per level from 13 to 16
-  Can Bind Wounds twice per day (1D(level)+1 up to a max of 1D20 +1)
-  Can Cure Poison and Disease once per day
-  Can cast 1st level mage spells, gaining a new one as an innate ability at levels 1, 8, 10 and 13
-  Can have 3 proficiency slots devoted to any thief weapon

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Has no backstab multiplier
-  Has a -50 penalty to pickpocketing
-  Requires 9 Intelligence and 14 Strength
-  Cannot Dual Class
-  Sets no snares
-  Cannot be an Elf or Halfling~
@21761 = ~Bind Wounds~
@217610 = ~merchant~
@217611 = ~Merchant~
@21762 = ~MERCHANT:
  The Merchant is far from a fighter, but more of a cunning thief. The Merchant uses his charismatic personality, and skills of persuasion and decption to abuse the trust people place in him, and obtain the goods and supplies he requires to sustain his lifestyle. As such, the Merchant is capable of entering a state in which he is able to convince almost anyone to accept almost any offer made to them. He also has the ability to create a special bag to hold his goods; the bag has no concept of space so all that he takes can be placed can be concealed however big it is. He, as a thief, is as good as any, but his physical benefits suffer and he has no special talents when backstabbing.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can enter into bartering mode once per day (25 Charisma for 1 turn)
-  Can create his own carry bag at level 10
-  Can enter into awareness mode once per day (Gains a bonus 100 points to pickpocketing skill)

DISADVANTAGES:
-  Cannot be of Good alignment
-  Has no backstab multiplier
-  Receives -1 to maximum Strength
-  Requires 13 Charisma and Intelligence
-  Cannot be an Elf or Halfling~

@217660 = ~Swindler~
@21767 = ~SWINDLER:
  The Swindler is a thief who thinks only about making money, and will use any means to achieve this goal. He usually gambles, but if he ends up losing, he will use his pick pocketing skills to get even; as a result of this, Swindlers are often one of the most hated types of rogues in any community. He also has skills with throwing weapons, using these skills to earn himself money. He has the ability of a fast getaway and can run very fast to prevent confrontation. The Swindler is not, however, known for hiding, and prefers a quick getaway to a stealthy retreat.

ADVANTAGES:
-  Can be of any alignment
-  Has +50 to pick pocketing skill
-  Can haste without fatigue at levels 1 and 12
-  Has +1 to damage and THAC0 with throwing weapons at level 1, +2 at level 12, and +3 at level 15
