@0    = ~Good morning, travellers. I hope you enjoyed and were replenished by the feast as much as myself. Ornamus is waiting to talk to you outside.~
@1    = ~Thank you, my friend. Charity is always welcome in these harsh climates.~
@2    = ~You call this hospitality? We save you from an army of yuan-ti, and this is it? I'll make sure Ornamus hears what I think about his so-called hospitality.~
