@0    = ~Yes, my friend? What is bothering you?~
@1    = ~I'm in need of a cleric's healing capabilities - a merchant has been stabbed and is bleeding to death. I was told that I might be able to find a healer near the town's centre. Could you help me?~
@2    = ~Nothing. Go away, you lousy cleric.~
@3    = ~I am a dedicated priest of Lathander, and will aid anyone in need. Please show me to this person hastily.~
@4    = ~Thank Lathander and these travellers for your life! We acted just in time.~
@5    = ~I was unsure if he would live, but your powers have saved his life. Skilled healers such as you make Faerun a better place to live.~
@6    = ~So, I see. Hopefully this man will be permanently healed. I don't always trust clerics with all these charlatans running around.~
@7    = ~Thank you for your kind words friend, but I must be on my way. Our friend here appears too wounded to speak. The pain will leave within an hour. Farewell, traveller.~
@8    = ~Do not worry, my friend. I assure you I am not a charlatan. It will be obvious when this man is up and running again. I must take my leave. Goodbye!~
