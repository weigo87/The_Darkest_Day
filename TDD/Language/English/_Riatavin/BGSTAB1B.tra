@0    = ~Thank you so much. I would be dead without your help.~
@1    = ~That is no problem... But, who stabbed you, and why?~
@2    = ~Yeah, yeah. I know. I'm the greatest. Tell me why you were stabbed.~
@3    = ~I was simply walking down a back street pushing my cart full of goods. Someone jumped out of the shadows and stabbed me several times in my chest. He spoke to me in a cold voice, "Now you know the consequences of disobeying Entreri's will."~
@4    = ~Entreri...that might explain where all the rogue thieves are coming from.~
@5    = ~I'm starting to like this guy. Seems like Entreri's got a good deal of authority.~
@6    = ~I am not staying here, taking any more chances with my life. Watch yourself and take care, stranger!~
