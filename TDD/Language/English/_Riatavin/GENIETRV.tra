@1    = ~Yeah, let's go. Calimport awaits.~
@2    = ~No, not yet. Wait for us; we will return shortly.~
@3    = ~Excellent. The journey shall be long, but unlike you, I don't get tired. Try to keep pace, eh?~

@5    = ~Yes, let's get moving.~
@6    = ~Not yet. Just hold on for a little while longer...~
@7    = ~Shall we leave before Calimshan crumbles to the ground? Please hurry. I do not have so great a patience as to wait for you.~
