@0    = ~I don't know about you, pal, but I can't wait to meet these filthy rogues head on. My blade hasn't tasted blood in a long time.~
@1    = ~I think you might need a little bit more caution. They seem to be a very dangerous foe.~
@2    = ~Agreed. Any rogue that crosses my path will be sliced and diced before even noticing my presence.~
@3    = ~What are you talking about? You tap him on the shoulder, you slit his throat. It's as simple as that.~
@4    = ~Aye, we'll show them shadowy renegades a thing or two. Cheers!~
