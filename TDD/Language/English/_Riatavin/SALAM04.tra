@0    = ~You fight well... very well. But you have earned a better foe than those fiends.~
@1    = ~Don't you think this is getting rather dangerous? What good am I to you dead or crippled?~
@2    = ~Bring them on!~
@3    = ~I don't need you to help me! I want to see you die. I could have had you killed by assassins, but these tasks and combat is so much more amusing.~
@4    = ~You have been too narrow-minded to realize that I have known what you were here for the whole time!~
@5    = ~You have been after the stone! Unfortunately for you, it is now out of reach, and you will fight until you die. Quite an amusing situation...~
@6    = ~Hahaha... good, you're eager for death. But, ah... You still don't seem to see, do you?~
