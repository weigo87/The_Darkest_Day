@0    = ~We are well on our way now. The docks are out of sight. I should remind you that you are free to jump overboard...but you won't survive if you choose to do so. You may be unfamiliar with the seas, so I'll tell you that sharks will take you down in no time. So if you wish to die, then by all means, feel free.~
@1    = ~We have no intention of jumping.~
@2    = ~If I could jump without dying, I would. However, this doesn't seem to be the best time for me to forfeit my life.~
@3    = ~How many ships are there?~
@4    = ~WHAT!? The Nelanther pirates never sail together. There must be some war on the horizon. But...wait...they head toward Athkatla!~
@5    = ~Damn! We must return and warn everyone. As for you lot; you will return, and if it gets ugly, you will fight or find yourself facing the tip of my own blade. Turn the boat, fast!~
@6    = ~Make haste! They have fired a shot!~
