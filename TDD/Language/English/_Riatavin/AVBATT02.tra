@0    = ~Your weak spell cannot cage me, mage! I am a descendant of one of the many who trapped you. He died... being human, without the lifespan of an elf.~
@1    = ~I will take you on in a show of the arcane. We shall see if white or dark magic rules these lands. The loser dies. You have no say in the matter. Win or die, fiend!~
