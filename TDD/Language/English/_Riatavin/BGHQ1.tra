@0    = ~You keep out of trouble, okay? We have more than enough problems from these assassins on the loose.~
@1    = ~How many would you say have fallen?~
@2    = ~You have a problem with assassins? If I were you, I'd start watching my back, then.~
@3    = ~No problem. I assure you, you'll get no trouble from me.~
@4    = ~About fifteen have been killed in only five days. Twelve of those were traders from other cities. At this rate, traders will be too scared to come near the city, let alone enter it.~
@5    = ~I get the feeling that might have been the idea. This clan must be stopped sooner or later.~
@6    = ~Sound like a brilliant strategy. I admire whomever is behind it greatly.~
@7    = ~Watch your tongue. You may be an assassin, but that doesn't mean we don't have people... keeping an eye on you.~
