@0    = ~Stop! I have picked up on the Drow's tracks... They lead north.~
@1    = ~Any ideas exactly where he'd be going?~
@2    = ~To the Amn region, you think?~
@3    = ~He probably seeks the assassin, Entreri... his force has been annihilated, and the assassin is the Drow's only surfacer friend.~
@4    = ~Then where do we even start to look?~
@5    = ~Drow wouldn't enter the city lest they be noticed... He would probably go somewhere like Umar where there are few people. And the caves would protect him from the sunlight.~
@6    = ~Then we leave for Umar.~
@7    = ~Without a doubt... he's probably searching out the assassin since he has no Drow force left.~
