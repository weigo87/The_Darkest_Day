@0    = ~Damn! I have missed the action, haven't I? Oh well, that doesn't take away from your success... you've done it!~
@1    = ~You're lucky that you didn't have to fight those vile beings.~
@2    = ~I have no doubt that missing the battle was on purpose.~
@3    = ~Think as you may. The demons have gone for now, but we are not in the clear... Orgoth himself has not shown his face yet.~
@4    = ~I never noticed, but now that I think about it, you are right.~
@5    = ~If he wants to go back to his eternal slumber, then he's just got to come looking for a fight.~
@6    = ~Wait... I sense something. Orgoth is nearby...~
