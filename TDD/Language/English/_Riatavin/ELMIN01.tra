@0    = ~The huge tower of dark crystal in the ward is the source, but that is just for show. It is powered by the real relic that is somewhat smaller.~
@1    = ~The ward welcomes all of magical potential including the pashas of the south. Just days ago, many came with Dao's and Djinnis. We are used to rare beings, but they found a way to take the diamond, and now the ward is losing power rapidly.~
@2    = ~If we fail to get the diamond back soon, then all forms of magic, be it items or spells, will fail for up to 500 miles.~
@3    = ~What am I to do about it?~
@4    = ~What are you telling me for?~
@5    = ~We are too well-known and could never walk in to the realm of a Pasha. Even while under a polymorph we would soon be discovered.~
