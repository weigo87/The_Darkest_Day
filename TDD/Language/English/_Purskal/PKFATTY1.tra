@0    = ~Hello, friend. Need anything?~
@1    = ~I'm just getting to know the village and the local color.~
@2    = ~I want to know where I can find the village leader. I wish to talk to him before I pass through.~
@3    = ~Well, that's not something you see every day 'round these parts. I'm Branthorl that over there is me wife, Faith; and that's me boy, Nielias. You're welcome to stay here, but as you can see, our life is far different from one that Athkatla provides.~
@4    = ~You'd want to be seein' Thorknar, then. He his the leader of the miners here, and along with most of 'em, he's a half-orc. You should find him in the main hall, no doubt. On yer way, don't be alarmed by the skeletons... they're just animals skinned for fur. Don't want you thinkin' we're barbarians, now...~
@5    = ~Thank you. I will go see him now.~
@6    = ~Could you tell me about yourself and the others who live here.~
@7    = ~That's enough. Farewell.~
