@0    = ~Ah, a visitor from the material plane has been absent for centuries, and you come commanding me to follow you? Hahaha! You fool! I cannot walk in your world, but I see all. You were forced to recite the incantations in the Book of the Dead... you've made a grave mistake. You have failed to obtain a ward from me and the only use you have for me is the book you hold. That book brought *you* here, it can send *me* back. Such foolishness! My legion cannot be conquered, and we will walk the land once more!~
