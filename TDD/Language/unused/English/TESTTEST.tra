@0    = ~Ah, you have recovered well from your long journey. Again, I thank you for your aid. The yuan-ti are proving to be a thorn in our collective foot as of late. That is the very reason why king Heafnall has gone north--to discover the source--but he has yet to return.~
@1    = ~His absence is the reason I need to talk to you. Our king has been gone much longer than anticipated. We have diminishing food supplies due to the raids, and our warriors are badly wounded. Will you aid us in this time of need?~
@2    = ~I am sorry Ornamus but my time here is over. I need to continue north without distractions. Unfortunately, your king is just that.~
@3    = ~I will aid you. We too are advancing to the peaks to find the source of the onslaught. If your king lives, then we will return him.~
@4    = ~A shame. We thank you for your aid but... you are no longer welcome here. I suggest you leave sooner rather than later.~
@5    = ~The longer you stay, the greater the chance you'll wake with an axe in your back. Farewell.~
@6    = ~My greatest thanks. Again, though I hate to say it, we are in your debt. You may use our supplies and healing before you leave.~
