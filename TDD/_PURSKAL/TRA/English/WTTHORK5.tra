@0    = ~We meet again traveller, I seemed to have been released from the beasts draining world of pain.~
@1    = ~How can this be? I saw you literally explode?~
@2    = ~All I know i that I awoke back in the tomb, you killing the lich must have released me somehow?~
@3    = ~That's fantastic news but how did you know of a lich? I saw your peril well before I knew of the beast?~
@4    = ~You don't fool easily do you traveller. I told you, when you thought you had won I would reveal the truth and I am doing that now. You can't kill me, I have gained powers in my suffering that you can't know. Thorknar's body will prove a good strong vessel for me to travel the lands in.~
@5    = ~You disgust me lich, you will not leave alive this time. Not only do you kill in extremely painful ways but you abuse the bodies of those that you have slain. I shall put an end to your wrath!~
@6    = ~We shall see traveller, we shall see.~
