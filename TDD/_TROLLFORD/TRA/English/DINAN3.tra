@0    = ~You have returned... and with my love! Keris! I can't thank you enough, Samaritan. The gods will smile on you for years to come.~
@1    = ~I hope that you have learned from this whole episode.~
@2    = ~No need to get all wet-eyed and mushy, boy.~
@3    = ~I sure have. I ain't going to places like that until I can defend myself properly.~
@4    = ~Glad to hear that; I may not be there the next time.~
@5    = ~I'm starting to think it would have been better if the trolls had caught you... but my musings are not that important.~
@6    = ~Again... I thank you. If not for you, I would be the meal of trolls. But, I must go. Keris needs to be healed, and I must take her home.~
