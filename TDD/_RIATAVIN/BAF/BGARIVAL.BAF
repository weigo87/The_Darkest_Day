They will realize it makes sense that one so potentially powerful would attempt to cause so much chaos, and they will take the fall. Riatavin will lose all ties with Athkatla as they have the aura of Riatavin locals. Athkatla will lose trade from a main supplier, and Calimport will be back in total control of the seas.
