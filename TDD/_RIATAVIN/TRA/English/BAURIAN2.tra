@0    = ~You have returned? But you have not been gone for more than thirty seconds! Come, let us attempt the ritual again.~
@1    = ~No, Baurian. We were successful.~
@2    = ~Only thirty seconds? It seems like we were there for hours.~
@3    = ~Time in Tartarus seems to work differently from our realm. Did you defeat the elven harbinger?~
@4    = ~We never had the chance to kill the demon for it was disposed of by Tartarus, himself.~
@5    = ~You killed Tartarus, as well? You must have...you have the talon.~
@6    = ~You are quick off the mark. Now, I believe we have one more wish.~
@7    = ~Indeed. It was one of the hardest battles I have ever fought. After his defeat, I was granted the three wishes. I have only wasted two so far.~
@8    = ~Then make your wish. I trust you will make a wise decision. That should be private matter, however, so I will leave you to yourself.~
