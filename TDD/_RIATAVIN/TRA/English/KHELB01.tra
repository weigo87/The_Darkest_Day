@0    = ~Allow me to explain it to you. In present day Athkatla, they are tough on magic, but not long ago it was completely forbidden. Many places in the realm kept it so for a long time.~
@1    = ~Unlike the huge Athkatla, Riatavin kept its magical practice alive, and this ward is often visited by great mages from the realms and outer planes. The ward has a magical essence; one that grants these mages power and sanctuary, that powers the ward's aura.~
@2    = ~The trip is long, but for the greater good. We wish you luck!~
