@1    = ~We are here to see if Ivralos from Riatavin passed through these gates in the last few days.~

@3    = ~Damn, as I suspected. Can you point me to Aramir, the director of Athkatla's trade, then?~
@4    = ~You will find him in the Council of Six Building.~
@5    = ~Okay, I must leave soon to speak with him. Farewell.~
@6    = ~No, really? I thought you could have helped me.~
