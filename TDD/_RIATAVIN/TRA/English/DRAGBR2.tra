@0    = ~Are you so keen to die Drow?~
@1    = ~What trickery is this?~
@2    = ~Indeed, I am keen to die. However, it will not be *you* that does the killing. That will be the dragon's job.~
@3    = ~This is no trickery. You Drow have your abilities, and I have those that I like to put to use.~
@4    = ~So you are a shapeshifter. You are clearly too weak to stay in you true form. Again I ask where the dragon is.~
@5    = ~Damn straight I have powers! ZAP! HA HA! I can see through your skin! Yes!~
